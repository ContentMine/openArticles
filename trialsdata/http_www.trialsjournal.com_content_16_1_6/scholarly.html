               </div>
               <p>Impairments of memory are commonly reported by people with traumatic brain injuries
                  (TBI). Such deficits are persistent, debilitating, and can severely impact quality
                  of life. Currently, many do not routinely receive follow-up appointments for residual
                  memory problems following discharge.

                  <h3>Methods/Design</h3>
               </div>
               <p>This is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial investigating the clinical and
                  cost-effectiveness of a group-based memory rehabilitation programme. Three hundred
                  and twelve people with a traumatic brain injury will be randomised from four centres.
                  Participants will be eligible if they had a traumatic brain injury more than 3 months
                  prior to recruitment, have memory problems, are 18 to 69 years of age, are able to
                  travel to one of our centres and attend group sessions, and are able to give informed
                  consent. Participants will be randomised in clusters of 4 to 6 to the group rehabilitation
                  intervention or to usual care. Intervention groups will receive 10 weekly sessions
                  of a manualised memory rehabilitation programme, which has been developed in previous
                  pilot studies. The intervention will include restitution strategies to retrain impaired
                  memory functions and compensation strategies to enable participants to cope with their
                  memory problems. All participants will receive a follow-up postal questionnaire and
                  an assessment by a research assistant at 6 and 12 months post-randomisation. The primary
                  outcome is the Everyday Memory Questionnaire at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include
                  the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test-3, General Health Questionnaire-30, health related
                  quality of life, cost-effectiveness analysis determined by the EQ-5D and a service
                  use questionnaire, individual goal attainment, European Brain Injury Questionnaire
                  (patient and relative versions), and the Everyday Memory Questionnaire-relative version.
                  The primary analysis will be based on intention to treat. A mixed-model regression
                  analysis of the Everyday Memory Questionnaire at 6 months will be used to estimate
                  the effect of the group memory rehabilitation programme.

               <p>The study will hopefully provide robust evidence regarding the clinical and cost-effectiveness

                  to trials.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Impairments of memory are the most common cognitive deficits reported by people with
         traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), affecting 40 to 60% of patients 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. These memory problems are not only persistent, but are debilitating and difficult
         to treat 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>. Memory deficits may also affect the extent to which patients engage with other interventions
         and rehabilitation. The safety of such patients can also be compromised, making them
         vulnerable citizens in the home (for example, forgetting to turn the stove off), community
         (for example, forgetting road rules), and work (for example, forgetting important
         documents) settings. Memory problems consequently have a devastating effect on the
         psychological wellbeing of the individuals and others around them 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Costs of morbidity due to TBI are incurred by the healthcare system and those outside
         it (in terms of loss of productivity due to short-term sick leave and early retirement),
         and through non-medical costs (for example, transformations of house or work environments,
         etc.). In addition, informal care by family or friends can dominate the costs of care
         for affected individuals. For TBI, the direct medical costs and indirect costs were
         estimated at $60 billion in the United States in 2000 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>. The full costs of dealing with memory problems caused by TBI in the UK are not known.
         Care costs escalate when an intervention is provided on an inpatient basis, but Salazar
         
         <i>et al</i>. 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span> demonstrated that the benefits of inpatient and home cognitive rehabilitation programmes
         for TBI, in terms of return to duty (for military personnel) or employment, were similar.
      </p>
      <p>Cognitive rehabilitation is a structured set of therapeutic activities designed to
         retrain an individual’s memory and other cognitive functions. A narrative review 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span> found cognitive rehabilitation to be beneficial for treating cognitive deficits following
         brain damage. There are recommendations for the provision of cognitive rehabilitation
         for people with acquired brain injuries (for example, European Federation of Neurological
         Societies Guidelines on cognitive rehabilitation 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>; National Service Framework for Long term Conditions 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>). However, recommendations are always qualified by statements that highlight the
         need for more research, to support the recommendations.
      </p>
      <p>Some randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the effectiveness of cognitive
         rehabilitation following brain injuries. These have mainly focussed on attention,
         executive functions, and visual neglect, but memory rehabilitation has not been sufficiently
         researched 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>. Most evidence for memory rehabilitation comes from single-case experimental design
         studies and controlled clinical trials. The few RCTs and quasi-RCTs in this area have
         offered some support for the effectiveness of intervention. Wilson 
         <i>et al</i>. 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span> examined an external memory aid, Neuropage. This enabled participants to achieve
         more memory-related goals than when it was not available. Doornhein and de Haan 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span> reported that patients who received a memory training programme performed significantly
         better than those in a pseudo-treatment control group on trained memory tasks, but
         no differences were observed on subjective ratings of everyday memory functions. Kaschel
         
         <i>et al</i>. 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span> reported that imagery mnemonics significantly improved delayed recall of verbal material
         and reduced observer-rated reports of memory failures. However, systematic reviews
         on memory rehabilitation have not found evidence to support or refute the effectiveness
         of such programmes 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">15</span>
         </span>. This lack of evidence is partly due to the paucity of well-designed trials and has
         led a recent meta-analysis to conclude that ‘the results for memory rehabilitation

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
         </span>. Patients with memory problems were randomly allocated to one of three group treatment
         programmes: compensation strategy training, restitution, or a self-help attention
         placebo control. The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences
         in outcome. However, the trend in the results and the qualitatively analysed participant
         feedback interviews 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">21</span>
         </span> indicated the interventions seemed worthy of further evaluation. These studies provided
         feasibility and pilot data for the present study.
      </p>
      <p>Currently, TBI patients with memory problems do not routinely receive follow-up rehabilitation
         after the early intensive phase, even though their abilities and needs may change
         once discharged from clinical services. This is mainly due to the current lack of
         evidence of clinical and cost-effectiveness of the intervention, and resource limitations.
         This study seeks to address these concerns.

         </div>
         <p>The primary objective is to determine whether attending a group memory rehabilitation
            programme is associated with subjective reports of improved management of memory in
            daily life when compared to a usual care (UC) control. The secondary objectives are
            to assess whether the intervention is associated with improvements in ‘objectively’
            assessed memory abilities, participants’ ability to achieve individually set goals,
            health-related quality of life, and cognitive, emotional and social wellbeing. Lastly,
            the cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be investigated.

            activated as old ones shut down due to their participant pools being exhausted.
         </p>
         <p>Participants are identified through NHS hospitals, rehabilitation centres and charities

            letter will include a patient information sheet, a consent form and a paid reply envelope.
            If the potential participant is interested in taking part, he or she is requested

         <p>The sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome measure (EMQ-p frequency
            total score) at six months post-randomisation. The main study aim is to detect a minimum
            clinically relevant difference in mean EMQ-p frequency total score of 12 between the
            memory intervention group and the usual care group. A 12-point difference on this

               <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
            </span> and clinical interviews. A common standard deviation of 21.9 from the pilot gives
            an effect size of 0.55. A type 1 error of 0.05 and power of 90% were used for the
            calculation. A fixed effects model at the level of the four centres is assumed, with
            10% of the total variation due to between-centre variation. The participants are cluster
            randomised into groups of 6 at the second level and a random effects model will be
            used with a small intracluster correlation coefficient assumed (ICC = 0.1). This ICC
            is likely to be small because within each centre the therapist, intervention, and
            delivery location do not vary. Using the ‘Optimal Design’ software with these parameters,
            the calculation gives 10 groups per centre. Data from the pilot study and taking account
            that the control group only receives usual care suggests a possible dropout rate of
            20%, so 26 groups of each intervention will be required or 312 participants in total.
            Based on our pilot study, we estimate we will need to screen 400 participants to recruit
            the required 312. Clinicians at the four centres have indicated that this is an achievable
            target in the timeframe proposed.

            <h3>Statistical analysis</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Database lock will take place once all data entries have been checked and sufficient
            verification processes have been completed. Analyses will be completed with Stata
            version 11.2 or above. The psychometric properties of the instruments used will be
            evaluated when sufficient baseline data have been collected. The baseline characteristics
            will be described using appropriate summary statistics to examine balance between
            the two randomised groups.
         </p>
         <p>The primary analysis will use a multi-level linear model with baseline EMQ score as
            a covariate, centre as a fixed effect and random effects, which take appropriate account
            of clustering according to allocated group

               <span tagx="abbr">36</span>
            </span>. The between group comparison will be presented as the difference in mean EMQ-p score
            at 6 months between the two groups with a 95% confidence interval 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">35</span>
               <span tagx="abbr">36</span>
            </span>. Participants will be analysed as randomised (Intention to Treat) regardless of adherence
            with allocation. It is planned that the primary analysis will be based on participants
            with available data with no imputation for participants with missing outcomes. The
            distributions of raw outcome scores and residuals will be examined and the data suitably
            transformed or a non-parametric analysis employed if necessary.
         </p>
         <p>Supportive analyses for the primary outcome will include imputation of missing data
            exploring different scenarios for the missing data, accounting for non-compliance
            with the group memory rehabilitation programme and adjusting for any characteristics
            assessed at baseline with an observed imbalance between the two groups.
         </p>
         <p>All secondary variables will be presented using appropriate descriptive statistics
            and analysed with appropriate regression models using the same techniques as for the
            primary outcome. Differences between the two groups will be presented with 95% confidence
            intervals. All secondary analyses will be interpreted with caution as the sample size
            calculation is based on the primary outcome. The analyses for all the outcomes will
            be repeated with the 12 month follow-up data following similar distribution checks.
         </p>
         <p>Full details of all statistical analyses will be given in a statistical analysis plan,

            <h3>Health economic evaluation</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The cost-effectiveness will be assessed from the perspective of the UK NHS and personal
            social services. The costs associated with the intervention will be determined by
            calculating the cost of staff time, materials, etc. used in providing the intervention.
            These will be compared with changes in the number of visits to GPs, hospital, prescribed
            medication, and social services contacts in the intervention and control groups during
            the investigation. The costs will be compared with the outcomes generated and a series
            of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios computed, including a cost/Quality Adjusted
            Life Year (QALY) analysis - based on changes in EQ-5D. A series of one-way sensitivity
            analyses will be undertaken to determine the extent to which baseline findings will
            change in light of parameter variation. Given the limited time duration of the study
            and follow-up, a decision analytic model will be constructed to determine the cost-effectiveness
            of the intervention from a lifetime perspective, a series of scenarios will be constructed
            to reflect the extent to which differential outcomes can be predicted to continue
            over longer time periods, using expert opinion and information available in the literature.
            A probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be carried out to determine the extent to
            which the intervention can be regarded as representing value for money.

            <h3>Assessment of safety and adverse events</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The adverse event risks of taking part in the study have been assessed. A part of
            the baseline assessment is to assess the memory of the participants such that they
            may become aware of memory problems that they did not know that they had. As a result,
            the main risk associated with this intervention is distress caused by the realisation
            that their memory is not as good as they had thought. However, first, distress caused
            in this way is considered very unlikely; and, second, any distress caused is likely
            to be mild. In addition, for the intervention group, this is also dealt with during
            the course of the intervention and the group therapy will address this on a participant
            by participant basis. So overall the risk has been assessed as negligible.

         </div>
         <p>A feedback interview will be conducted within 2 months of the 6 month appointments,
            with 32 purposefully selected and willing participants: 16 from each group. This will
            be 4 intervention and 4 control participants, from each participating centre. The
            selection strategy will be designed to include participants with varying levels of
            memory impairments, and with varying social situations. The interviews will be conducted
            by a second RA (RA2) who was not involved with the participant’s assessment or treatment,
            thereby reducing social desirability response bias. The RA2 will become aware of the
            group allocations during the interview so will not be blind to the intervention. The
            interview will be audio recorded using a digital recorder, transcribed, and analysed
            using a thematic analysis (following the protocol prescribed by Braun and Clarke 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">

            </span>). Participant consent for the interviews will be sought separately. The interviews
            will provide important feedback on participants’ perception of progress over time
            and for those in the intervention groups, the quality of the interventions provided,
            and as such will serve as a process measure. Insights from this qualitative data and
            analysis will serve to inform developments of the intervention programme in the future
            and to generate user-oriented proposals about areas for further investigations. For
            those in the control group the interviews will provide confirmation of the nature
            of usual care received.

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>This study was conceptualised in response to a commissioned call for ‘proposals concerning
         people needing physical or psychological rehabilitation following trauma in a military
         or civilian context’ from the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">38</span>
         </span>. Based on our pilot work 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span> and feedback from participants 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">21</span>
         </span>, we decided to combine restitution and compensation approaches in the intervention.
         We also decided to have a usual care control group, as having a self-help control
         group was difficult to organise and facilitate.
      </p>
      <p>Our choice of primary outcome measure was a point of contention, with some of our
         reviewers suggesting ‘objective’ measures of memory, others recommending the use of
         goal attainment scaling, and yet others agreeing that the primary outcome had to be
         a subjective report of memory function in daily life. We have retained both an objective
         measure of memory and a measure of goal attainment, but these are secondary outcomes.
         Most objective measures have poor ecological validity. Goal attainment poses challenges
         in setting goals that can be precisely measured and the changeable nature of some
         of the goals, given that our outcomes are measured 6 and 12 months after the goals
         were set.
      </p>
      <p>We anticipate that one of the biggest challenges to recruit to this study will be
         potential participants’ memory problems themselves. Even those interested in taking
         part in this trial when they receive our invitation letter may forget to respond.
         To address this, we have sought an amendment to our original ethics approval to include
         a single phone call to follow-up non-responders to the invitation letter to enquire
         whether they remember receiving the letter and whether they would like to participate.
