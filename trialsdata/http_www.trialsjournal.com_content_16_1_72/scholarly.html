                  <h3>Background</h3>
               </div>
               <p>The ‘Adaptive Designs Accelerating Promising Trials into Treatments (ADAPT-IT)’ project
                  is a collaborative effort supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and
                  United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) to explore how adaptive clinical trial
                  design might improve the evaluation of drugs and medical devices. ADAPT-IT uses the
                  National Institute of Neurologic Disorders &amp; Stroke-supported Neurological Emergencies
                  Treatment Trials (NETT) network as a ‘laboratory’ in which to study the development
                  of adaptive clinical trial designs in the confirmatory setting. The Stroke Hyperglycemia
                  Insulin Network Effort (SHINE) trial was selected for funding by the NIH-NINDS at
                  the start of ADAPT-IT and is currently an ongoing phase III trial of tight glucose
                  control in hyperglycemic acute ischemic stroke patients. Within ADAPT-IT, a Bayesian
                  adaptive Goldilocks trial design alternative was developed.

               <div tagx="st">
                  <h3>Methods</h3>
               </div>
               <p>The SHINE design includes response adaptive randomization, a sample size re-estimation,
                  and monitoring for early efficacy and futility according to a group sequential design.
                  The Goldilocks design includes more frequent monitoring for predicted success or futility
                  and a longitudinal model of the primary endpoint. Both trial designs were simulated
                  and compared in terms of their mean sample size and power across a range of treatment
                  effects and success rates for the control group.

                  <h3>Results</h3>
               </div>
               <p>As simulated, the SHINE design tends to have slightly higher power and the Goldilocks
                  design has a lower mean sample size. Both designs were tuned to have approximately
                  80% power to detect a difference of 25% versus 32% between control and treatment,
                  respectively. In this scenario, mean sample sizes are 1,114 and 979 for the SHINE
                  and Goldilocks designs, respectively.

                  <h3>Conclusions</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Two designs were brought forward, and both were evaluated, revised, and improved based
                  on the input of all parties involved in the ADAPT-IT process. However, the SHINE investigators
                  were tasked with choosing only a single design to implement and ultimately elected
                  not to implement the Goldilocks design. The Goldilocks design will be retrospectively
                  executed upon completion of SHINE to later compare the designs based on their use
                  of patient resources, time, and conclusions in a real world setting.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>In 2010, The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration
         (FDA) jointly awarded four grants to support research in the area of regulatory science
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. One of these awards, ‘Adaptive Designs Accelerating Promising Trials into Treatments
         (ADAPT-IT)’, is a collaborative effort between the University of Michigan, Medical
         University of South Carolina, and Berry Consultants, LLC. The overall objective of
         ADAPT-IT is to explore how adaptive designs in a confirmatory setting might improve
         the evaluation of drugs and medical devices in neurologic emergency settings 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. ADAPT-IT uses the NINDS-supported Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials (NETT)
         network as a ‘laboratory’ in which to study the development of adaptive clinical trial
         designs. The NETT Network includes 22 hubs, along with a clinical coordinating center
         (University of Michigan), and statistical and data management center (Medical University
         of South Carolina) and focuses on conducting large trials in acute injuries and illnesses
         affecting the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>. For each of five randomized clinical trials undergoing proposal development for
         implementation within NETT, the ADAPT-IT investigators developed an adaptive trial
         design in collaboration with each study’s principal investigators and statisticians
         at the data coordinating center. During this process another research team used both
         qualitative and quantitative methods to characterize the beliefs, opinions, and concerns
         of the trial’s key stakeholders regarding the ethics, scientific validity, and integrity
         of the adaptive designs and how these beliefs may have changed over the course of
         the design process.
      </p>
      <p>The ADAPT-IT process begins with an initial meeting of clinical investigators and
         statisticians to describe the scientific question and sketch out potential designs.
         An initial adaptive design is then constructed and presented to the trial team for
         feedback. There are several iterations of the design and accompanying discussions.
         Once a final design is agreed upon, the trial is submitted for funding.
      </p>
      <p>Each of the five trials included in ADAPT-IT were at varying stages of development
         and funding. The first trial considered within ADAPT-IT, the Stroke Hyperglycemia
         Insulin Network Effort (SHINE) trial had a completed design. Also, unlike the other
         four trials, SHINE was approved for funding by the NIH-NINDS at the time the ADAPT-IT
         project began. Regardless, through the ADAPT-IT process, an alternative adaptive design
         was developed. We present the SHINE trial design that is currently being conducted,
         which is an adaptive design including group sequential stopping, response adaptive
         randomization, and a blinded sample size re-estimation. We also present the alternative
         ADAPT-IT design, which is a Bayesian adaptive Goldilocks trial design 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>. We compare the performance of the two designs via simulation and then describe how
         SHINE will be virtually re-executed according to the Goldilocks design.
      </p>
      <p>There are examples where an alternative trial design has been retrospectively created
         and executed in order to compare the potential benefits of different design features
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>. However, SHINE is a unique learning opportunity in that the same team developed,
         in a prospective manner, two different trial designs with the same scientific objectives
         in mind. In the trial design process, it is typical to consider several different
         candidate designs. One design is selected for conduct and the alternatives are discarded.
         However, we propose to consider both the selected design and the counterfactual, comparing
         and contrasting both the design and the execution of two innovative adaptive trial
         designs.
      </p>
      <p>The two designs we will describe have several differences, and therefore, this is
         not an ‘apples to apples’ comparison where we compare one simple difference at a time.
         However, this is also not an academic exercise in which the goal is to consider only
         the difference between the frequentist and the Bayesian perspectives. Rather, we present
         a more ‘real world’ setting in which two candidate designs are weighed against each
         other based on their own unique sets of benefits and drawbacks.

            <h3>SHINE trial design</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The SHINE trial design is completely described elsewhere 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
            </span>. SHINE is a randomized multicenter Phase III trial comparing tight glucose control
            with IV insulin (experimental) to a therapy of subcutaneous insulin (control) in hyperglycemic
            acute ischemic stroke patients. The SHINE protocol was approved by IRBs at the University
            of Virginia, the NETT Clinical Coordinating Center (University of Michigan), and Statistics
            and Data Management Center (Medical University of South Carolina), as well as all
            enrolling sites. The name of the ethical body that approved the SHINE protocol at
            each enrolling site is shown in the appendix. Consent is obtained either from patients,
            or where cognitively impaired from stroke, a legally authorized representative, before
            a patient is enrolled in the SHINE trial.
         </p>
         <p>The primary efficacy endpoint is a dichotomized modified Rankin scale (mRS), adjusted
            to the baseline stroke severity score (NIHSS), measured at 90 days following randomization.
            The null hypothesis is that the success rates for the two arms are equal. The alterative
            hypothesis is two-sided, that the success rates for the two arms are not equal. The
            alternative hypothesis will be accepted if either the experimental therapy is significantly
            better than the control or if the control therapy is significantly better than the
            experimental. Based on preliminary data, it is expected that 25% of patients in the
            control group will achieve success. At least a 7% absolute difference in the proportion
            of patients achieving a success between the treatment and control arms would be considered
            clinically meaningful. Based on a chi-square test, four interim analyses, an overall
            0.05 Type I error rate, a control success rate of 25%, and a 3% lost to follow-up
            rate, 1,400 patients would provide 80% power to detect the 7% absolute difference
            between treatment arms.
         </p>
         <p>SHINE will be monitored for both early efficacy and futility according to a group
            sequential design. The stopping boundaries are defined by the gamma family spending
            function with a parameter of −4 for both the upper and lower bounds. Four interim
            analyses are scheduled when complete information on the primary endpoint (90-day data)
            is available for 500, 700, 900, and 1,100 patients. The two-sided 
            <i>P</i> values required for stopping for efficacy or futility at each of these interim looks
            are shown in Table 
            <span tagx="tblr">1</span>. To control the overall two-sided Type I error rate to less than 5%, the final analysis
            will be conducted at the 0.043 significance level. The primary efficacy analysis will
            be a logistic regression model with terms for treatment group, baseline NIHSS strata,
            and use of IV thrombolysis use (yes or no). Multiple imputation will be implemented
            when the 90-day outcome is missing or collected outside of the allowable window of
            −14 day/+30 days from the 90-day visit.

         <p>SHINE also contains a sample-size re-estimation analysis to ensure 80% power if the
            control success rate is higher than expected and variance is increased. The sample
            size re-estimation will follow the approach of Gould and Shih 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
            </span>, and will be based on the observed overall success rate and assuming a 7% absolute
            difference between treatment arms. If the overall pooled success rate is greater than
            31%, the maximum sample size may be increased. As specified in Gould and Shih, to
            maintain the blind, the sample size re-estimation is planned just prior to the first
            unblinded interim analysis. If the sample size is increased, the timing of the interim
            looks will be adjusted accordingly to preserve the planned information fraction at
            each look. The largest possible increase to the maximum sample size would be 318 patients.
         </p>
         <p>Finally, patients will be randomized to either the experimental or control arm based
            on a randomization scheme that includes both covariate balancing and response adaptive
            randomization. Covariates to be balanced are the baseline NIHSS (3 strata), use of
            IV thrombolysis (yes or no), and site. As SHINE is currently ongoing, to prevent operational
            bias, the details of the response adaptive randomization component of the design have
            not been provided to the SHINE study investigators who are potentially enrolling patients
            and are not included in this manuscript.

            <h3>Goldilocks design alternative</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The only constraints applied to the alternative design for the SHINE design were having
            a maximum sample size of 1,400 patients, and the assumptions of a control rate favorable
            outcome of 25% where a 7% improvement would be clinically meaningful. All other design
            parameters were subject to change.
         </p>
         <p>The alternative SHINE trial design is a Bayesian adaptive Goldilocks design that includes
            frequent interim looks, based on predictive probabilities, to stop early for efficacy
            or futility 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
            </span>,
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
            </span>. Because patients can also be assessed for mRS at 6 weeks, we use a longitudinal
            model of the primary endpoint to allow the 6-week measure of mRS to aid prediction
            of mRS at 90 days. Patients are equally randomized to either the experimental or control
            arm. The minimum sample size is 500 patients, and the maximum sample size is 1,400
            patients and there are scheduled interim analyses after every additional 100 patients
            are enrolled. The primary analysis is fully Bayesian, comparing the posterior distributions
            of the success rates between the two arms. In this design, the alternative hypothesis
            is one-sided, that the success rate on the experimental arm is greater than on the
            control arm. The rationale for a one-sided alternative hypothesis is that the clinical
            implications of either futility (the two treatments being similar) or the experimental
            therapy being worse than control are the same - patients would continue to receive
            the control treatment, the current standard of care. Therefore this design would not
            continue in order to show that the experimental therapy is significantly worse than
            control.

         <p>Interim monitoring for early efficacy or futility begins when 500 patients are enrolled

            a total of nine possible interim analyses. Interim monitoring for futility is based

         <p>The probability of 0.979 is similar to a one-sided critical value of 0.021 in a frequentist
            trial. This critical value for the final analysis was selected through simulation
            to control the one-sided Type I error rate of this trial, given the multiple interim
            analyses, to less than 0.025. SHINE’s two-sided 0.05 and the Goldilocks’ one-sided
            0.025 Type I error rates are equivalent. However, the overall Type I error was assessed
            for the Goldilocks design by simulation. The null space is defined both by the accrual
            rate and the response rates for both groups. Type I error control was shown by simulation
            only considering an accrual rate of 33 patients per month and for a response rate
            of 25% in both arms. The overall Type I error of the design may be larger or smaller
            at other points in the null space.

            <h3>Longitudinal model and predictive probabilities</h3>
         </div>
         <p>As described above, interim analyses for efficacy and futility are based on predictive
            probability calculations. Because of a lag between enrollment and when the primary
            endpoint is observed, at each interim analysis there will be patients who have complete
            information through 90 days, more recently enrolled patients who may have only 6-week
            assessment of mRS, and the most recently enrolled patients who provide only baseline
            information. For the predictive probability calculations, we utilize the information
            from patients with incomplete information to the extent that the baseline and 6-week
            assessments are associated with the primary endpoint at 90 days. Patients with complete
            information inform this association.
         </p>
         <p>A Bayesian model is built to learn the associations between the earlier 6-week time
            point and the primary endpoint at 90 days. For each arm, we use three beta-binomial
            distributions to model the transition:
         </p>
         <p>1) from baseline to 90-days for patients with baseline information only,</p>
         <p>2) from 6 weeks to 90-days for patients who were a success at 6 weeks, and</p>
         <p>3) from 6 weeks to 90-days for patients who were not a success at 6 weeks.</p>
         <p>Because the arms are modeled independently and identically, we present the longitudinal
            model generically without reference to treatment group. At each interim analysis with
            a total of 
            <i>n</i> patients enrolled, the number of patients with complete follow-up through 90-days
            is

         <p>For the predictive probability of success at the maximum sample size, we perform a
            similar calculation but assume the trial continues enrollment to the maximum sample
            size of 1,400 patients. However, this requires calculation of the predictive distribution
            of success for patients not yet enrolled. These future patients are included in the
            predictive probability calculation described above as patients that have only a baseline
            assessment (no available interim data).

      <p>To determine the operating characteristics of each design, we simulated both the SHINE
         design and the Goldilocks design across a range of treatment effects and a range of
         success rates for the control group. The SHINE design was simulated including the
         group sequential stopping boundaries, the sample size re-estimation, and using a chi-square
         test between treatment groups as the primary analysis (consistent with the primary
         power calculation). The response adaptive randomization component of the design was
         not included in order to preserve the operational integrity of the trial. The Goldilocks
         design was simulated exactly as described above. Simulation code was written in the
         R statistical language 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span> and 10,000 trials were simulated for each scenario. All simulations assume no lost
         to follow-up, and an accrual rate of 33 patients per month. Thus, at each interim
         analysis there are approximately 100 patients enrolled but without complete follow-up
         through 90 days. The nature of the longitudinal data necessary for simulation of the
         Goldilocks design was estimated based on the transitions in mRS observed within the
         raw data from the NINDS tPA trial including both the tPA and control groups since

         <p>Across all simulated scenarios, the SHINE design tends to enroll a greater number
            of patients than the Goldilocks design. The difference in sample size between the
            two designs is attributable to a different number of interim analyses, different mechanisms
            for early stopping, differing aggressiveness of the stopping boundaries, and that
            SHINE is based on a two-sided alternative hypothesis while the Goldilocks design is
            based on a one-sided alternative hypothesis.
         </p>
         <p>The SHINE design includes four interim analyses and the Goldilocks design includes
            nine. With more interim analyses, the Goldilocks design has more opportunities to
            stop early. Additionally, the two designs have different mechanisms for early stopping
            and differently account for complete follow-up of all enrolled patients should the
            trial stop early. Early stopping for the SHINE design is based on the information
            fraction, or the number of patients with observed 90-day outcomes. It stops early
            only when observed 90-day data produces an overwhelming effect for efficacy or futility.
            For example, when 1,000 patients are enrolled, we expect that 900 patients will have
            complete data. The trial will stop for efficacy if, based on these 900 patients, the
            
            <i>P</i> value is less than 0.008 (Table 
            <span tagx="tblr">1</span>) and the trial is considered a success. There is no defined critical value for a
            later analysis that might include the 100 outstanding patients once they have completed
            follow-up.
         </p>
         <p>Early stopping in the Goldilocks design is based on the number of patients enrolled
            and allows for complete follow-up of all enrolled patients. Thus, the Goldilocks design
            is able to have more aggressive early stopping behavior, stopping accrual and then
            allowing for the additional follow-up of enrolled patients in order to observe the
            necessary information for success, whereas the SHINE design stops only once the necessary
            information for success is already observed. The Goldilocks design might stop when
            900 patients are enrolled, and 800 patients have complete data, as long as there is
            a high probability that including the outstanding 100 patients in the final analysis
            (many of whom have interim 6-week mRS values) would result in trial success. In the
            Goldilocks design, all enrolled patients are explicitly included in the final analysis.
         </p>
         <p>The difference in expected sample size is largest when the control is only slightly
            better than the experimental arm. The alternative hypothesis for the SHINE design
            is two-sided, but is one-sided for the Goldilocks design. This contributes to different
            stopping behavior when the control arm is only slightly better than the treatment.
            In these scenarios, the Goldilocks design stops early for futility, reacting to the
            fact that it is unlikely the experimental treatment will be proven to be superior
            to the control. The SHINE design continues in these scenarios, not crossing a futility
            boundary (the treatments are the same), and not seeing a large enough treatment effect
            to cross a success boundary (the control is significantly better than the experimental).

            <h3>Probability of trial success</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The right panel of Figure 
            <div tagx="figr">1</div> shows the probability of trial success for the two designs. When the treatment effect
            is null, SHINE has an analytically controlled two-sided overall Type I error rate
            of 5% and the Goldilocks design has a simulated one-sided Type I error rate of approximately
            2.5%. We present only one null scenario, and the Type I error rate for the Goldilocks
            design may vary across the null space. When the treatment arm is slightly worse than
            control, the SHINE design may conclude success of control over treatment, whereas
            the Goldilocks design cannot. Thus, the SHINE design has a higher probability of trial
            success in these scenarios.
         </p>
         <p>When the control rate is 25%, the probability of success in scenarios where the treatment
            is better than control is similar between the two designs. As the control rate increases,
            a small amount of power is lost in the Goldilocks design. The Goldilocks design loses
            approximately 2% power when the control rate increases from 25% to 30%, and approximately
            another 2% power when the control rate increases from 30% to 35%.
         </p>
         <p>The SHINE design includes a sample size re-estimation to preserve power if the control
            rate is higher than expected. Thus, as the control rate increases, the power of the
            design is unchanged. However, the mean sample size increases (left panel Figure 
            <div tagx="figr">1</div>). In the most extreme case, the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) could be
            asked to increase the sample size from 1,400 to 1,718 patients. Figure 
            <div tagx="figr">2</div> shows the probability that the SHINE maximum sample size is increased and the mean
            number of patients added. The size of the sample size re-estimation is proportional
            to the pooled success rate and so depends on both the control success rate and the
            treatment effect. Because the sample size re-estimation is blinded it is not possible
            to diagnose whether a high pooled event rate is due to a higher than expected control
            rate, or to a larger than expected treatment effect. In fact, because the treatment
            effect is fixed at 7% in the sample size re-estimation procedure, a high pooled event
            rate is always attributed to a higher than expected control rate. As a result, even
            when the true control rate is 25%, a large treatment effect can trigger a sample size
            increase and the larger the treatment effect, the larger the increase to the maximum
            sample size. However, with a large treatment effect, the trial is then also likely
            to stop early for success. The trial’s mean sample size does not increase by exactly
            the number of patients added to the maximum sample size because of this potential
            for early success stopping. However, the potential delay to the first interim look
            may translate to an increase in the mean sample size.

            <h3>Compare and contrast</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The strengths of the SHINE design include the sample size re-estimation and the covariate
            adjusted final analysis. SHINE has analytical control of overall Type I error, and
            as simulated, the SHINE design offers a slight advantage in terms of power. Covariates
            were not included in the simulation study, but a covariate adjusted primary analysis
            is likely to increase the trial’s overall power from what was simulated. With fewer
            interim analyses, there is also less operational complexity. However, the adaptive
            randomization component was not included in the simulations. This type of randomization
            scheme has the potential to increase operational complexity and reduce power. While
            response adaptive randomization would likely randomize more patients to the more effective
            therapy, the power of the trial could be reduced because in a two-arm trial, equal
            allocation between arms should provide maximum power.
         </p>
         <p>The strengths of the Goldilocks design include more frequent interim analyses, the
            longitudinal model of the primary outcome, and explicitly accounting for patients
            with incomplete follow-up if accrual to the trial where to stop early. The Goldilocks
            design offers advantages in terms of sample size. If accrual to the trial is faster
            than expected, the difference in sample size between the two designs will be greater
            than described here. If accrual to the trial is slower than expected, the difference
            in sample size will be smaller. Accrual to clinical trials is frequently slower than
            expected. While the Goldilocks design randomizes patients equally to the two treatment
            arms, an increased potential to stop the trial earlier would allow results to be communicated
            earlier and would allow patients outside the trial to be treated with the more effective
            therapy sooner.
         </p>
         <p>The comparison of operating characteristics should be interpreted with caution bearing
            in mind the many differences between the two designs (Table 
            <span tagx="tblr">2</span>), in particular the differences in the stopping boundaries and the limitations of
            the simulation study, specifically that covariates and the adaptive randomization
            component of the SHINE design were not included. The operating characteristics of
            the Goldilocks design, in particular Type I error control, are assessed with simulation
            and so the Type I error rates of the two designs may not be exactly equal across the
            entire null space. While we see that the SHINE design offers advantages in terms of
            power and that the Goldilocks offers advantages in terms of sample size, we expect
            that a greater sample size would confer greater power. The largest difference in power
            we observed in the simulations was when the control rate was 35% and the treatment
            rate was 41%. In this scenario SHINE has 9.5% more power (58.6% versus 68.1%) and
            enrolls an average of 308 additional patients.
         </p>
         <p>None of the simulated scenarios showed a similar sample size between the two designs,
            the Goldilocks design always had a smaller mean sample size. In the primary expected
            scenario of 32% vs. 25%, both designs are tuned to have approximately 80% power, and
            the average sample size in SHINE is 135 patients higher than in the Goldilocks design
            (1,114 vs. 979). For similar powers the Goldilocks trial saves at least 100 patients,
            oftentimes more. When the difference between arms is very small, only 2%, the two
            designs have similar power, approximately 12%, regardless of the control rate. The
            SHINE design averages 273, 322, and 429 more patients at control rates of 25%, 30%,
            and 35%, respectively. When the treatment effect is large, 10%, SHINE has an additional
            1 to 3% power, but averages and additional 139, 178, and 213 patients at control rates
            of 25%, 30%, and 35%, respectively.

            <h3>Trial execution</h3>
         </div>
         <p>SHINE is currently ongoing. The Goldilocks design will be virtually executed upon
            completion of SHINE using the observed patient data from SHINE. The purpose of this
            virtual trial execution is to determine the resources used and resulting evidence
            for the comparison of the experimental versus control arms had SHINE been conducted
            according to the Goldilocks design. The outcomes of the two trial executions can be
            compared in terms of final trial conclusions, total number of patients enrolled, number
            of patients enrolled to the most effective treatment arm, and trial duration.
         </p>
         <p>This exercise will require datasets that provide snapshots of the accumulated data
            from SHINE to conduct each of the planned interim analyses and the final analysis.
            The trial’s data coordinating center has agreed to provide these snap shots and store
            these blinded datasets until the SHINE results are released. If SHINE stops accrual
            early, but the Goldilocks design indicates continuing enrollment, patients for the
            future interim analyses for the Goldilocks design will be simulated by re-sampling
            the observed SHINE patients. We emphasize that we have a prospectively defined design
            and execution plan. Limitations in the re-execution approach will be assessed and
            reported at the time the re-execution is performed.

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The original SHINE design presented within ADAPT-IT included response adaptive randomization
         and had one futility analysis (700 patients with complete data, 50% information) and
         one early success stopping analysis (938 patients with complete data, 67% information).
         As the work within ADAPT-IT progressed, the potential benefits of additional interim
         analyses were discussed. The number of interim analyses for SHINE was re-evaluated
         and the design was updated to the four interim analyses for early stopping as described
         here. The Goldilocks design was then finalized. External to the ADAPT-IT process,
         a sample size re-estimation was then added to the SHINE design and the simulation
         exercise presented here was then performed. Certainly, the two designs could continue
         to be iterated to be more similar or pieces of one design could be included in the
         other. For example, the Goldilocks design could allow a larger sample size and a covariate
         adjusted final analysis, which are strengths in the SHINE trial design. The SHINE
         design could have more frequent interim analyses or account for patients with incomplete
         follow-up when the study stops, which are strengths in the Goldilocks design. However,
         we present the Goldilocks design as it was developed at the time and we present the
         SHINE design as it is being conducted.
      </p>
      <p>The SHINE investigators were tasked with choosing only a single design to implement
         and ultimately elected not to implement the Goldilocks alternative. A main aspect
         for consideration was the potential for formal ‘flip-flop’. The Goldilocks design
         stops accrual for predicted success if the probability for success with the currently
         enrolled patients, allowing for the outstanding (approximately) 100 patients to reach
         their 90-day endpoint, is greater than 99%. There is a small chance that the trial
         could stop for predicted success, complete follow-up of the enrolled patients, and
         then at the final analysis, miss the 0.979 posterior probability threshold required
         for trial success. For example, in the scenario where the experimental treatment offers
         a 7% absolute benefit, the trial stopped early for predicted success 62% of the time
         and in 0.5% of those cases, failed to obtain the final critical value for success.
         Most likely, if such a flip-flop occurs, the experimental treatment is not effective.
         While such flip-flops occur in 0.5% of early stopping cases when the treatment is
         effective (+7%) they occurred in 6% of cases when the treatment is ineffective - largely
         because of regression to the mean in those cases and this in fact helps to conserve
         Type I error. Even if this were to occur, the final 
         <i>P</i> value would likely still be just a little larger than the critical value.
      </p>
      <p>It is important to recognize that this potential exists in a group sequential design
         as well. While such an occurrence is similarly unlikely, it is not well characterized
         or formally accounted for. Stopping based on predictive probabilities explicitly accounts
         for complete follow-up of all enrolled patients and so it is natural to quantify the
         ‘flip-flop’. Group sequential stopping is typically based on the amount of information
         observed and while methods exist to account for ‘overrun’ 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span>, the typical implementation of group sequential designs does not dictate how to handle
         patients with incomplete information should the trial stop early. These designs typically
         do not include a formal analysis on all enrolled patients and so do not specify the
         critical value needed for such an analysis. Our simulations of the SHINE design show
         that in this case such an analysis would likely not meet the 
         <i>P</i> value that was required for early stopping, simply due to regression to the mean,
         but is likely to meet the 
         <i>P</i> value required for success at the end of the trial with complete information (data
         not shown).
      </p>
      <p>A second consideration for the SHINE investigators surrounding the Goldilocks design
         was a wholesale change of the design after it had already been through the NIH peer
         review process and had been selected for funding. Additionally, there was concern
         from the SHINE PI about whether the design and final analysis would be accepted by
         the clinical community given the small number phase III trials that have utilized
         a Bayesian approach.
      </p>
      <p>One of the larger differences between the two designs is that SHINE is a two-sided
         alternative hypothesis while the Goldilocks design is one-sided. Although the error
         rates are similar, differences in sample size and power between the two designs are
         confounded with this difference in hypothesis testing in the setting where the standard
         of care arm is slightly better than the tight control arm. While two-sided trials
         are standard, and hence the choice for the SHINE investigators, the Goldilocks design
         considers it unlikely that a DSMB would let a trial proceed only to show that an expensive,
         more laborious therapy is in fact significantly inferior to the standard of care.
         However, the clinical community is currently quite divided on the utility of intensive
         glucose control in stroke and both the SHINE and the NETT leadership believe that
         the greatest opportunity for SHINE to leave stroke physicians with a definitive answer
         is through the two-sided design. Certainly, there are many stroke physicians who would
         be satisfied with the one-sided hypothesis tested by the Goldilocks design, yet there
         is a concern that practice will not be changed unless there is a definitive answer
         in favor of one treatment or the other. Of course, even the two-sided design may end
         in the null space; given the additional resources required to perform the intense
         glucose controls it is likely that most would abandon this treatment.
      </p>
      <p>The primary lesson learned in the ADAPT-IT design process for SHINE was about the
         value of trial simulation. Trial simulation may typically be associated Bayesian designs
         or with more complex adaptive designs, such as where a close form solution for Type
         I error and power are not available. In the ADAPT-IT design process, clinical trial
         simulation illuminated several points of discussion with both designs. Clinical trial
         simulation of the Goldilocks design was necessary to understand its early stopping
         behavior and the potential for ‘flip-flop’. A remedy for ‘flip-flop’ is to increase
         the threshold required for early stopping, which was done during the design process,
         but this will decrease the probability of early stopping and increase mean sample
         size. Such trade-offs can only be assessed through the process of clinical trial simulation.
         Trial simulation also illuminated the differences in trial behavior due to two-sided
         versus one-sided hypothesis testing for the investigators and initiated the discussion
         about which test would ultimately be used in the conduct of the trial.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, the SHINE design includes two ‘well understood’ 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span> adaptive trial features that are commonly used in phase III trials: a blinded sample
         size re-estimation and group sequential stopping boundaries. While the statistical
         properties of each are completely understood separately, combining two well-understood
         design features does not add up to a well-understood design. For example, when the
         experimental therapy is performing better than control, the sample size may be increased
         due to the sample size re-estimation and the first interim analysis will be delayed.
         The trial may stop for success, though with additional patients and more time than
         it might require otherwise. Given that the experimental therapy is performing well,
         the additional patients and time could be undesirable. On the other hand, the delay
         could be considered small and worth the protection of power that the sample size re-estimation
         provides. Even with the simulation exercise presented here, the SHINE design is still
         not completely characterized because covariates and the adaptive randomization component
         are not included.

         <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The goal of this project was to illustrate two alternative real-world designs, the
         two primary designs considered for a multi-center NIH-funded randomized clinical trial.
         Because they are two real-world designs, simple head-to-head comparisons changing
         one feature at a time are not possible and the alternative trials must be judged on
         the totality of their operating characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>The consideration of alternative trial designs was a successful venture in that two
         designs were brought forward, and both were evaluated, revised, and improved based
         on the input of all parties involved in the ADAPT-IT process. Simulation of an entire
         design as it will be conducted was necessary to evaluate the selected design features
         in concert with each other and to inform the study team of the gains/losses associated
         with various design choices. Trial simulation should not be reserved for only complex
         adaptive designs. Rather, all trialists should consider trial simulation an important
         tool for developing a complete understanding of the statistical properties of their
         trial design
