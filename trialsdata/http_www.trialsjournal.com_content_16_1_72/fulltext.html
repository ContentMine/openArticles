   <div class="collapsible-content">
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The ‘Adaptive Designs Accelerating Promising Trials into Treatments (ADAPT-IT)’ project
         is a collaborative effort supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and
         United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) to explore how adaptive clinical trial
         design might improve the evaluation of drugs and medical devices. ADAPT-IT uses the
         National Institute of Neurologic Disorders &amp; Stroke-supported Neurological Emergencies
         Treatment Trials (NETT) network as a ‘laboratory’ in which to study the development
         of adaptive clinical trial designs in the confirmatory setting. The Stroke Hyperglycemia
         Insulin Network Effort (SHINE) trial was selected for funding by the NIH-NINDS at
         the start of ADAPT-IT and is currently an ongoing phase III trial of tight glucose
         control in hyperglycemic acute ischemic stroke patients. Within ADAPT-IT, a Bayesian
         adaptive Goldilocks trial design alternative was developed.
      </p>
      <h4>Methods</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The SHINE design includes response adaptive randomization, a sample size re-estimation,
         and monitoring for early efficacy and futility according to a group sequential design.
         The Goldilocks design includes more frequent monitoring for predicted success or futility
         and a longitudinal model of the primary endpoint. Both trial designs were simulated
         and compared in terms of their mean sample size and power across a range of treatment
         effects and success rates for the control group.
      </p>
      <h4>Results</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">As simulated, the SHINE design tends to have slightly higher power and the Goldilocks
         design has a lower mean sample size. Both designs were tuned to have approximately
         80% power to detect a difference of 25% versus 32% between control and treatment,
         respectively. In this scenario, mean sample sizes are 1,114 and 979 for the SHINE
         and Goldilocks designs, respectively.
      </p>
      <h4>Conclusions</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Two designs were brought forward, and both were evaluated, revised, and improved based
         on the input of all parties involved in the ADAPT-IT process. However, the SHINE investigators
         were tasked with choosing only a single design to implement and ultimately elected
         not to implement the Goldilocks design. The Goldilocks design will be retrospectively
         executed upon completion of SHINE to later compare the designs based on their use
         of patient resources, time, and conclusions in a real world setting.

   <div class="collapsible-content">
      <p style="line-height:160%">In 2010, The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration
         (FDA) jointly awarded four grants to support research in the area of regulatory science
         <a name="d81468e192"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B1'); return false;" href="#B1">1</a>]. One of these awards, ‘Adaptive Designs Accelerating Promising Trials into Treatments
         (ADAPT-IT)’, is a collaborative effort between the University of Michigan, Medical
         University of South Carolina, and Berry Consultants, LLC. The overall objective of
         ADAPT-IT is to explore how adaptive designs in a confirmatory setting might improve
         the evaluation of drugs and medical devices in neurologic emergency settings <a name="d81468e196"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B2'); return false;" href="#B2">2</a>]. ADAPT-IT uses the NINDS-supported Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials (NETT)
         network as a ‘laboratory’ in which to study the development of adaptive clinical trial
         designs. The NETT Network includes 22 hubs, along with a clinical coordinating center
         (University of Michigan), and statistical and data management center (Medical University
         of South Carolina) and focuses on conducting large trials in acute injuries and illnesses
         affecting the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system <a name="d81468e200"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B3'); return false;" href="#B3">3</a>]. For each of five randomized clinical trials undergoing proposal development for
         implementation within NETT, the ADAPT-IT investigators developed an adaptive trial
         design in collaboration with each study’s principal investigators and statisticians
         at the data coordinating center. During this process another research team used both
         qualitative and quantitative methods to characterize the beliefs, opinions, and concerns
         of the trial’s key stakeholders regarding the ethics, scientific validity, and integrity
         of the adaptive designs and how these beliefs may have changed over the course of
         the design process.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The ADAPT-IT process begins with an initial meeting of clinical investigators and
         statisticians to describe the scientific question and sketch out potential designs.
         An initial adaptive design is then constructed and presented to the trial team for
         feedback. There are several iterations of the design and accompanying discussions.
         Once a final design is agreed upon, the trial is submitted for funding.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Each of the five trials included in ADAPT-IT were at varying stages of development
         and funding. The first trial considered within ADAPT-IT, the Stroke Hyperglycemia
         Insulin Network Effort (SHINE) trial had a completed design. Also, unlike the other
         four trials, SHINE was approved for funding by the NIH-NINDS at the time the ADAPT-IT
         project began. Regardless, through the ADAPT-IT process, an alternative adaptive design
         was developed. We present the SHINE trial design that is currently being conducted,
         which is an adaptive design including group sequential stopping, response adaptive
         randomization, and a blinded sample size re-estimation. We also present the alternative
         ADAPT-IT design, which is a Bayesian adaptive Goldilocks trial design <a name="d81468e208"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B4'); return false;" href="#B4">4</a>]. We compare the performance of the two designs via simulation and then describe how
         SHINE will be virtually re-executed according to the Goldilocks design.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">There are examples where an alternative trial design has been retrospectively created
         and executed in order to compare the potential benefits of different design features
         <a name="d81468e214"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B5'); return false;" href="#B5">5</a>],<a name="d81468e218"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B6'); return false;" href="#B6">6</a>]. However, SHINE is a unique learning opportunity in that the same team developed,
         in a prospective manner, two different trial designs with the same scientific objectives
         in mind. In the trial design process, it is typical to consider several different
         candidate designs. One design is selected for conduct and the alternatives are discarded.
         However, we propose to consider both the selected design and the counterfactual, comparing
         and contrasting both the design and the execution of two innovative adaptive trial
         designs.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The two designs we will describe have several differences, and therefore, this is
         not an ‘apples to apples’ comparison where we compare one simple difference at a time.
         However, this is also not an academic exercise in which the goal is to consider only
         the difference between the frequentist and the Bayesian perspectives. Rather, we present
         a more ‘real world’ setting in which two candidate designs are weighed against each
         other based on their own unique sets of benefits and drawbacks.

   <div class="collapsible-content">
      <h4>SHINE trial design</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The SHINE trial design is completely described elsewhere <a name="d81468e234"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B7'); return false;" href="#B7">7</a>]. SHINE is a randomized multicenter Phase III trial comparing tight glucose control
         with IV insulin (experimental) to a therapy of subcutaneous insulin (control) in hyperglycemic
         acute ischemic stroke patients. The SHINE protocol was approved by IRBs at the University
         of Virginia, the NETT Clinical Coordinating Center (University of Michigan), and Statistics
         and Data Management Center (Medical University of South Carolina), as well as all
         enrolling sites. The name of the ethical body that approved the SHINE protocol at
         each enrolling site is shown in the appendix. Consent is obtained either from patients,
         or where cognitively impaired from stroke, a legally authorized representative, before
         a patient is enrolled in the SHINE trial.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The primary efficacy endpoint is a dichotomized modified Rankin scale (mRS), adjusted
         to the baseline stroke severity score (NIHSS), measured at 90&nbsp;days following randomization.
         The null hypothesis is that the success rates for the two arms are equal. The alterative
         hypothesis is two-sided, that the success rates for the two arms are not equal. The
         alternative hypothesis will be accepted if either the experimental therapy is significantly
         better than the control or if the control therapy is significantly better than the
         experimental. Based on preliminary data, it is expected that 25% of patients in the
         control group will achieve success. At least a 7% absolute difference in the proportion
         of patients achieving a success between the treatment and control arms would be considered
         clinically meaningful. Based on a chi-square test, four interim analyses, an overall
         0.05 Type I error rate, a control success rate of 25%, and a 3% lost to follow-up
         rate, 1,400 patients would provide 80% power to detect the 7% absolute difference
         between treatment arms.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">SHINE will be monitored for both early efficacy and futility according to a group
         sequential design. The stopping boundaries are defined by the gamma family spending
         function with a parameter of −4 for both the upper and lower bounds. Four interim
         analyses are scheduled when complete information on the primary endpoint (90-day data)
         is available for 500, 700, 900, and 1,100 patients. The two-sided <em>P</em> values required for stopping for efficacy or futility at each of these interim looks
         are shown in Table&nbsp;<a name="d81468e244"></a><a onclick="popup('http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/72/table/T1','',800,470); return false;" href="http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/72/table/T1">1</a>. To control the overall two-sided Type I error rate to less than 5%, the final analysis
         will be conducted at the 0.043 significance level. The primary efficacy analysis will
         be a logistic regression model with terms for treatment group, baseline NIHSS strata,
         and use of IV thrombolysis use (yes or no). Multiple imputation will be implemented
         when the 90-day outcome is missing or collected outside of the allowable window of
         −14&nbsp;day/+30&nbsp;days from the 90-day visit.
         
      </p><div class="figs">
      <div class="table"><p><a onclick="popup('http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/72/table/T1','T1',800,470); return false;" href="http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/72/table/T1"><strong>Table 1.</strong></a> <strong>SHINE two-sided</strong><strong><em>P</em></strong><strong>values for stopping for success or futility at each interim analysis</strong></div></div>
      <p style="line-height:160%">SHINE also contains a sample-size re-estimation analysis to ensure 80% power if the
         control success rate is higher than expected and variance is increased. The sample
         size re-estimation will follow the approach of Gould and Shih <a name="d81468e342"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B8'); return false;" href="#B8">8</a>], and will be based on the observed overall success rate and assuming a 7% absolute
         difference between treatment arms. If the overall pooled success rate is greater than
         31%, the maximum sample size may be increased. As specified in Gould and Shih, to
         maintain the blind, the sample size re-estimation is planned just prior to the first
         unblinded interim analysis. If the sample size is increased, the timing of the interim
         looks will be adjusted accordingly to preserve the planned information fraction at
         each look. The largest possible increase to the maximum sample size would be 318 patients.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Finally, patients will be randomized to either the experimental or control arm based
         on a randomization scheme that includes both covariate balancing and response adaptive
         randomization. Covariates to be balanced are the baseline NIHSS (3 strata), use of
         IV thrombolysis (yes or no), and site. As SHINE is currently ongoing, to prevent operational
         bias, the details of the response adaptive randomization component of the design have
         not been provided to the SHINE study investigators who are potentially enrolling patients
         and are not included in this manuscript.
      </p>
      <h4>Goldilocks design alternative</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The only constraints applied to the alternative design for the SHINE design were having
         a maximum sample size of 1,400 patients, and the assumptions of a control rate favorable
         outcome of 25% where a 7% improvement would be clinically meaningful. All other design
         parameters were subject to change.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The alternative SHINE trial design is a Bayesian adaptive Goldilocks design that includes
         frequent interim looks, based on predictive probabilities, to stop early for efficacy
         or futility <a name="d81468e356"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B4'); return false;" href="#B4">4</a>],<a name="d81468e360"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B9'); return false;" href="#B9">9</a>]. Because patients can also be assessed for mRS at 6&nbsp;weeks, we use a longitudinal
         model of the primary endpoint to allow the 6-week measure of mRS to aid prediction
         of mRS at 90&nbsp;days. Patients are equally randomized to either the experimental or control
         arm. The minimum sample size is 500 patients, and the maximum sample size is 1,400
         patients and there are scheduled interim analyses after every additional 100 patients
         are enrolled. The primary analysis is fully Bayesian, comparing the posterior distributions
         of the success rates between the two arms. In this design, the alternative hypothesis
         is one-sided, that the success rate on the experimental arm is greater than on the
         control arm. The rationale for a one-sided alternative hypothesis is that the clinical
         implications of either futility (the two treatments being similar) or the experimental
         therapy being worse than control are the same - patients would continue to receive
         the control treatment, the current standard of care. Therefore this design would not
         continue in order to show that the experimental therapy is significantly worse than
         control.
      </p>
      <h4>Interim monitoring</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Interim monitoring for early efficacy or futility begins when 500 patients are enrolled
         and interim analyses are planned after every additional 100 patient are enrolled for
         a total of nine possible interim analyses. Interim monitoring for futility is based
         on the predictive probability that the trial will be successful at the maximum sample
         size of 1,400 patients, <em>P</em><sub><em>max</em></sub>. If, at any interim analysis <em>P</em><sub><em>max</em></sub> is less than 5%<sub>,</sub> the trial will stop for futility. Interim monitoring for efficacy is based on the
         predictive probability that the trial will be successful at the current sample size,
         <em>n</em>, if accrual to the trial would stop and all currently enrolled patients completed
         follow-up, <em>P</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>. If, at any interim analysis <em>P</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> is greater than 99%, accrual will stop for predicted success. If the trial is not
         stopped early for futility or if accrual is not stopped early for predicted success
         (<em>P</em><sub><em>max</em></sub> &gt;5% and <em>P</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> &lt;99%), then the trial will continue enrollment to the maximum sample size. If accrual
         stops early for predicted success, or the trial continues to the maximum sample size
         of 1,400 patients, the primary efficacy analysis will be conducted when all enrolled
         patients have completed their 90-day follow-up.
      </p>
      <h4>Primary efficacy analysis</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted after all enrolled patients have completed
         follow-up for the primary endpoint. We assume the probability of success, <em>θ</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>, has a Beta prior distribution

         to control the one-sided Type I error rate of this trial, given the multiple interim
         analyses, to less than 0.025. SHINE’s two-sided 0.05 and the Goldilocks’ one-sided
         0.025 Type I error rates are equivalent. However, the overall Type I error was assessed
         for the Goldilocks design by simulation. The null space is defined both by the accrual
         rate and the response rates for both groups. Type I error control was shown by simulation
         only considering an accrual rate of 33 patients per month and for a response rate
         of 25% in both arms. The overall Type I error of the design may be larger or smaller
         at other points in the null space.
      </p>
      <h4>Longitudinal model and predictive probabilities</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">As described above, interim analyses for efficacy and futility are based on predictive
         probability calculations. Because of a lag between enrollment and when the primary
         endpoint is observed, at each interim analysis there will be patients who have complete
         information through 90&nbsp;days, more recently enrolled patients who may have only 6-week
         assessment of mRS, and the most recently enrolled patients who provide only baseline
         information. For the predictive probability calculations, we utilize the information
         from patients with incomplete information to the extent that the baseline and 6-week
         assessments are associated with the primary endpoint at 90&nbsp;days. Patients with complete
         information inform this association.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">A Bayesian model is built to learn the associations between the earlier 6-week time
         point and the primary endpoint at 90&nbsp;days. For each arm, we use three beta-binomial
         distributions to model the transition:
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">1) from baseline to 90-days for patients with baseline information only,</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">2) from 6&nbsp;weeks to 90-days for patients who were a success at 6&nbsp;weeks, and</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">3) from 6&nbsp;weeks to 90-days for patients who were not a success at 6&nbsp;weeks.</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Because the arms are modeled independently and identically, we present the longitudinal
         model generically without reference to treatment group. At each interim analysis with
         a total of <em>n</em> patients enrolled, the number of patients with complete follow-up through 90-days
         is <em>n</em><sub><em>c</em></sub>. The number of these patients who have achieved a success is <em>x</em> and the number of these patients who did not achieve success is <em>z</em>. The number of patients enrolled but who have incomplete information is <em>n</em><sup><em>*</em></sup>. Thus <em>n = n</em><sub><em>c</em></sub> 
         <em>+ n</em><sup><em>*</em></sup> 
         <em>= x + z</em> + <em>n</em><sup><em>*</em></sup>.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">For the <em>n</em><sup><em>*</em></sup> patients with incomplete information, they either 1) have no 6-week follow-up<em>, n</em><sup><em>*</em></sup><sub><em>0</em></sub>, 2) have achieved success at 6&nbsp;weeks, <em>n</em><sup><em>*</em></sup><sub><em>+</em></sub> or 3) have not achieved success at 6&nbsp;week, <em>n</em><sup><em>*</em></sup><sub><em>-.</em></sub> For each of these three groups, we use a beta-binomial model to predict the number
         of these patients who will be a success on the primary 90-day endpoint. Given the
         currently observed <em>n</em><sub><em>c</em></sub> patients with complete data, the number of patients in each of the three incomplete
         information groups who will be a success on the primary endpoint is

         there is an associated probability for every possible number of total successes if

         analysis, whether Pr(<em>θ</em><sub><em>E</em></sub> &gt; <em>θ</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> &gt;0.979). Summing the probabilities for the cases that would result in trial success
         is the predictive probability of trial success for the currently enrolled patients.

         similar calculation but assume the trial continues enrollment to the maximum sample
         size of 1,400 patients. However, this requires calculation of the predictive distribution
         of success for patients not yet enrolled. These future patients are included in the
         predictive probability calculation described above as patients that have only a baseline
         assessment (no available interim data).

         how each design behaves in terms of power and mean sample size across a range of scenarios.

      <p style="line-height:160%">To determine the operating characteristics of each design, we simulated both the SHINE
         design and the Goldilocks design across a range of treatment effects and a range of
         success rates for the control group. The SHINE design was simulated including the
         group sequential stopping boundaries, the sample size re-estimation, and using a chi-square
         test between treatment groups as the primary analysis (consistent with the primary
         power calculation). The response adaptive randomization component of the design was
         not included in order to preserve the operational integrity of the trial. The Goldilocks
         design was simulated exactly as described above. Simulation code was written in the
         R statistical language <a name="d81468e1398"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B10'); return false;" href="#B10">10</a>] and 10,000 trials were simulated for each scenario. All simulations assume no lost
         to follow-up, and an accrual rate of 33 patients per month. Thus, at each interim
         analysis there are approximately 100 patients enrolled but without complete follow-up
         through 90&nbsp;days. The nature of the longitudinal data necessary for simulation of the
         Goldilocks design was estimated based on the transitions in mRS observed within the
         raw data from the NINDS tPA trial including both the tPA and control groups since
         SHINE includes both <a name="d81468e1402"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B11'); return false;" href="#B11">11</a>].

Generally,
         when the treatment effects are null or small, both designs stop early for futility
         and when the treatment effects are large, both designs stop early for success. Thus,
         sample sizes are smaller at each end of the treatment effect range than in the middle.
         
      </p><div class="figs">
      <div class="fig"><p><a onclick="popup('http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/72/figure/F1','F1',800,470); return false;" href="http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/72/figure/F1"><img align="top" src="/content/figures/s13063-015-0574-8-1.gif" alt="thumbnail" class="thumbnail"><strong>Figure 1.</strong></a> <strong>Mean total sample size enrolled (left panel) and probability of trial success (right

      </div></div>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Across all simulated scenarios, the SHINE design tends to enroll a greater number
         of patients than the Goldilocks design. The difference in sample size between the
         two designs is attributable to a different number of interim analyses, different mechanisms
         for early stopping, differing aggressiveness of the stopping boundaries, and that
         SHINE is based on a two-sided alternative hypothesis while the Goldilocks design is
         based on a one-sided alternative hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The SHINE design includes four interim analyses and the Goldilocks design includes
         nine. With more interim analyses, the Goldilocks design has more opportunities to
         stop early. Additionally, the two designs have different mechanisms for early stopping
         and differently account for complete follow-up of all enrolled patients should the
         trial stop early. Early stopping for the SHINE design is based on the information
         fraction, or the number of patients with observed 90-day outcomes. It stops early
         only when observed 90-day data produces an overwhelming effect for efficacy or futility.
         For example, when 1,000 patients are enrolled, we expect that 900 patients will have
         complete data. The trial will stop for efficacy if, based on these 900 patients, the
         <em>P</em> value is less than 0.008 (Table&nbsp;<a name="d81468e1434"></a><a onclick="popup('http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/72/table/T1','',800,470); return false;" href="http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/72/table/T1">1</a>) and the trial is considered a success. There is no defined critical value for a
         later analysis that might include the 100 outstanding patients once they have completed
         follow-up.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Early stopping in the Goldilocks design is based on the number of patients enrolled
         and allows for complete follow-up of all enrolled patients. Thus, the Goldilocks design
         is able to have more aggressive early stopping behavior, stopping accrual and then
         allowing for the additional follow-up of enrolled patients in order to observe the
         necessary information for success, whereas the SHINE design stops only once the necessary
         information for success is already observed. The Goldilocks design might stop when
         900 patients are enrolled, and 800 patients have complete data, as long as there is
         a high probability that including the outstanding 100 patients in the final analysis
         (many of whom have interim 6-week mRS values) would result in trial success. In the
         Goldilocks design, all enrolled patients are explicitly included in the final analysis.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The difference in expected sample size is largest when the control is only slightly
         better than the experimental arm. The alternative hypothesis for the SHINE design
         is two-sided, but is one-sided for the Goldilocks design. This contributes to different
         stopping behavior when the control arm is only slightly better than the treatment.
         In these scenarios, the Goldilocks design stops early for futility, reacting to the
         fact that it is unlikely the experimental treatment will be proven to be superior
         to the control. The SHINE design continues in these scenarios, not crossing a futility
         boundary (the treatments are the same), and not seeing a large enough treatment effect
         to cross a success boundary (the control is significantly better than the experimental).
      </p>
      <h4>Probability of trial success</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The right panel of Figure&nbsp;<a name="d81468e1447"></a><a onclick="popup('http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/72/figure/F1','',800,470); return false;" href="http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/72/figure/F1">1</a> shows the probability of trial success for the two designs. When the treatment effect
         is null, SHINE has an analytically controlled two-sided overall Type I error rate
         of 5% and the Goldilocks design has a simulated one-sided Type I error rate of approximately
         2.5%. We present only one null scenario, and the Type I error rate for the Goldilocks
         design may vary across the null space. When the treatment arm is slightly worse than
         control, the SHINE design may conclude success of control over treatment, whereas
         the Goldilocks design cannot. Thus, the SHINE design has a higher probability of trial
         success in these scenarios.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">When the control rate is 25%, the probability of success in scenarios where the treatment
         is better than control is similar between the two designs. As the control rate increases,
         a small amount of power is lost in the Goldilocks design. The Goldilocks design loses
         approximately 2% power when the control rate increases from 25% to 30%, and approximately
         another 2% power when the control rate increases from 30% to 35%.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The SHINE design includes a sample size re-estimation to preserve power if the control
         rate is higher than expected. Thus, as the control rate increases, the power of the
         design is unchanged. However, the mean sample size increases (left panel Figure&nbsp;<a name="d81468e1454"></a><a onclick="popup('http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/72/figure/F1','',800,470); return false;" href="http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/72/figure/F1">1</a>). In the most extreme case, the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) could be
         asked to increase the sample size from 1,400 to 1,718 patients. Figure&nbsp;<a name="d81468e1457"></a><a onclick="popup('http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/72/figure/F2','',800,470); return false;" href="http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/72/figure/F2">2</a> shows the probability that the SHINE maximum sample size is increased and the mean
         number of patients added. The size of the sample size re-estimation is proportional
         to the pooled success rate and so depends on both the control success rate and the
         treatment effect. Because the sample size re-estimation is blinded it is not possible
         to diagnose whether a high pooled event rate is due to a higher than expected control
         rate, or to a larger than expected treatment effect. In fact, because the treatment
         effect is fixed at 7% in the sample size re-estimation procedure, a high pooled event
         rate is always attributed to a higher than expected control rate. As a result, even
         when the true control rate is 25%, a large treatment effect can trigger a sample size
         increase and the larger the treatment effect, the larger the increase to the maximum
         sample size. However, with a large treatment effect, the trial is then also likely
         to stop early for success. The trial’s mean sample size does not increase by exactly
         the number of patients added to the maximum sample size because of this potential
         for early success stopping. However, the potential delay to the first interim look
         may translate to an increase in the mean sample size.

      <h4>Compare and contrast</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The strengths of the SHINE design include the sample size re-estimation and the covariate
         adjusted final analysis. SHINE has analytical control of overall Type I error, and
         as simulated, the SHINE design offers a slight advantage in terms of power. Covariates
         were not included in the simulation study, but a covariate adjusted primary analysis
         is likely to increase the trial’s overall power from what was simulated. With fewer
         interim analyses, there is also less operational complexity. However, the adaptive
         randomization component was not included in the simulations. This type of randomization
         scheme has the potential to increase operational complexity and reduce power. While
         response adaptive randomization would likely randomize more patients to the more effective
         therapy, the power of the trial could be reduced because in a two-arm trial, equal
         allocation between arms should provide maximum power.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The strengths of the Goldilocks design include more frequent interim analyses, the
         longitudinal model of the primary outcome, and explicitly accounting for patients
         with incomplete follow-up if accrual to the trial where to stop early. The Goldilocks
         design offers advantages in terms of sample size. If accrual to the trial is faster
         than expected, the difference in sample size between the two designs will be greater
         than described here. If accrual to the trial is slower than expected, the difference
         in sample size will be smaller. Accrual to clinical trials is frequently slower than
         expected. While the Goldilocks design randomizes patients equally to the two treatment
         arms, an increased potential to stop the trial earlier would allow results to be communicated
         earlier and would allow patients outside the trial to be treated with the more effective
         therapy sooner.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The comparison of operating characteristics should be interpreted with caution bearing
         in mind the many differences between the two designs (Table&nbsp;<a name="d81468e1483"></a><a onclick="popup('http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/72/table/T2','',800,470); return false;" href="http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/72/table/T2">2</a>), in particular the differences in the stopping boundaries and the limitations of
         the simulation study, specifically that covariates and the adaptive randomization
         component of the SHINE design were not included. The operating characteristics of
         the Goldilocks design, in particular Type I error control, are assessed with simulation
         and so the Type I error rates of the two designs may not be exactly equal across the
         entire null space. While we see that the SHINE design offers advantages in terms of
         power and that the Goldilocks offers advantages in terms of sample size, we expect
         that a greater sample size would confer greater power. The largest difference in power
         we observed in the simulations was when the control rate was 35% and the treatment
         rate was 41%. In this scenario SHINE has 9.5% more power (58.6% versus 68.1%) and
         enrolls an average of 308 additional patients.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">None of the simulated scenarios showed a similar sample size between the two designs,
         the Goldilocks design always had a smaller mean sample size. In the primary expected
         scenario of 32% vs. 25%, both designs are tuned to have approximately 80% power, and
         the average sample size in SHINE is 135 patients higher than in the Goldilocks design
         (1,114 vs. 979). For similar powers the Goldilocks trial saves at least 100 patients,
         oftentimes more. When the difference between arms is very small, only 2%, the two
         designs have similar power, approximately 12%, regardless of the control rate. The
         SHINE design averages 273, 322, and 429 more patients at control rates of 25%, 30%,
         and 35%, respectively. When the treatment effect is large, 10%, SHINE has an additional
         1 to 3% power, but averages and additional 139, 178, and 213 patients at control rates
         of 25%, 30%, and 35%, respectively.
      </p>
      <h4>Trial execution</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">SHINE is currently ongoing. The Goldilocks design will be virtually executed upon
         completion of SHINE using the observed patient data from SHINE. The purpose of this
         virtual trial execution is to determine the resources used and resulting evidence
         for the comparison of the experimental versus control arms had SHINE been conducted
         according to the Goldilocks design. The outcomes of the two trial executions can be
         compared in terms of final trial conclusions, total number of patients enrolled, number
         of patients enrolled to the most effective treatment arm, and trial duration.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">This exercise will require datasets that provide snapshots of the accumulated data
         from SHINE to conduct each of the planned interim analyses and the final analysis.
         The trial’s data coordinating center has agreed to provide these snap shots and store
         these blinded datasets until the SHINE results are released. If SHINE stops accrual
         early, but the Goldilocks design indicates continuing enrollment, patients for the
         future interim analyses for the Goldilocks design will be simulated by re-sampling
         the observed SHINE patients. We emphasize that we have a prospectively defined design
         and execution plan. Limitations in the re-execution approach will be assessed and
         reported at the time the re-execution is performed.

<section><a name="sec4"></a><h3>Discussion</h3>
   <div class="collapsible-content">
      <p style="line-height:160%">The original SHINE design presented within ADAPT-IT included response adaptive randomization
         and had one futility analysis (700 patients with complete data, 50% information) and
         one early success stopping analysis (938 patients with complete data, 67% information).
         As the work within ADAPT-IT progressed, the potential benefits of additional interim
         analyses were discussed. The number of interim analyses for SHINE was re-evaluated
         and the design was updated to the four interim analyses for early stopping as described
         here. The Goldilocks design was then finalized. External to the ADAPT-IT process,
         a sample size re-estimation was then added to the SHINE design and the simulation
         exercise presented here was then performed. Certainly, the two designs could continue
         to be iterated to be more similar or pieces of one design could be included in the
         other. For example, the Goldilocks design could allow a larger sample size and a covariate
         adjusted final analysis, which are strengths in the SHINE trial design. The SHINE
         design could have more frequent interim analyses or account for patients with incomplete
         follow-up when the study stops, which are strengths in the Goldilocks design. However,
         we present the Goldilocks design as it was developed at the time and we present the
         SHINE design as it is being conducted.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The SHINE investigators were tasked with choosing only a single design to implement
         and ultimately elected not to implement the Goldilocks alternative. A main aspect
         for consideration was the potential for formal ‘flip-flop’. The Goldilocks design
         stops accrual for predicted success if the probability for success with the currently
         enrolled patients, allowing for the outstanding (approximately) 100 patients to reach
         their 90-day endpoint, is greater than 99%. There is a small chance that the trial
         could stop for predicted success, complete follow-up of the enrolled patients, and
         then at the final analysis, miss the 0.979 posterior probability threshold required
         for trial success. For example, in the scenario where the experimental treatment offers
         a 7% absolute benefit, the trial stopped early for predicted success 62% of the time
         and in 0.5% of those cases, failed to obtain the final critical value for success.
         Most likely, if such a flip-flop occurs, the experimental treatment is not effective.
         While such flip-flops occur in 0.5% of early stopping cases when the treatment is
         effective (+7%) they occurred in 6% of cases when the treatment is ineffective - largely
         because of regression to the mean in those cases and this in fact helps to conserve
         Type I error. Even if this were to occur, the final <em>P</em> value would likely still be just a little larger than the critical value.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">It is important to recognize that this potential exists in a group sequential design
         as well. While such an occurrence is similarly unlikely, it is not well characterized
         or formally accounted for. Stopping based on predictive probabilities explicitly accounts
         for complete follow-up of all enrolled patients and so it is natural to quantify the
         ‘flip-flop’. Group sequential stopping is typically based on the amount of information
         observed and while methods exist to account for ‘overrun’ <a name="d81468e1510"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B12'); return false;" href="#B12">12</a>], the typical implementation of group sequential designs does not dictate how to handle
         patients with incomplete information should the trial stop early. These designs typically
         do not include a formal analysis on all enrolled patients and so do not specify the
         critical value needed for such an analysis. Our simulations of the SHINE design show
         that in this case such an analysis would likely not meet the <em>P</em> value that was required for early stopping, simply due to regression to the mean,
         but is likely to meet the <em>P</em> value required for success at the end of the trial with complete information (data
         not shown).
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">A second consideration for the SHINE investigators surrounding the Goldilocks design
         was a wholesale change of the design after it had already been through the NIH peer
         review process and had been selected for funding. Additionally, there was concern
         from the SHINE PI about whether the design and final analysis would be accepted by
         the clinical community given the small number phase III trials that have utilized
         a Bayesian approach.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">One of the larger differences between the two designs is that SHINE is a two-sided
         alternative hypothesis while the Goldilocks design is one-sided. Although the error
         rates are similar, differences in sample size and power between the two designs are
         confounded with this difference in hypothesis testing in the setting where the standard
         of care arm is slightly better than the tight control arm. While two-sided trials
         are standard, and hence the choice for the SHINE investigators, the Goldilocks design
         considers it unlikely that a DSMB would let a trial proceed only to show that an expensive,
         more laborious therapy is in fact significantly inferior to the standard of care.
         However, the clinical community is currently quite divided on the utility of intensive
         glucose control in stroke and both the SHINE and the NETT leadership believe that
         the greatest opportunity for SHINE to leave stroke physicians with a definitive answer
         is through the two-sided design. Certainly, there are many stroke physicians who would
         be satisfied with the one-sided hypothesis tested by the Goldilocks design, yet there
         is a concern that practice will not be changed unless there is a definitive answer
         in favor of one treatment or the other. Of course, even the two-sided design may end
         in the null space; given the additional resources required to perform the intense
         glucose controls it is likely that most would abandon this treatment.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The primary lesson learned in the ADAPT-IT design process for SHINE was about the
         value of trial simulation. Trial simulation may typically be associated Bayesian designs
         or with more complex adaptive designs, such as where a close form solution for Type
         I error and power are not available. In the ADAPT-IT design process, clinical trial
         simulation illuminated several points of discussion with both designs. Clinical trial
         simulation of the Goldilocks design was necessary to understand its early stopping
         behavior and the potential for ‘flip-flop’. A remedy for ‘flip-flop’ is to increase
         the threshold required for early stopping, which was done during the design process,
         but this will decrease the probability of early stopping and increase mean sample
         size. Such trade-offs can only be assessed through the process of clinical trial simulation.
         Trial simulation also illuminated the differences in trial behavior due to two-sided
         versus one-sided hypothesis testing for the investigators and initiated the discussion
         about which test would ultimately be used in the conduct of the trial.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Finally, the SHINE design includes two ‘well understood’ <a name="d81468e1528"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B13'); return false;" href="#B13">13</a>] adaptive trial features that are commonly used in phase III trials: a blinded sample
         size re-estimation and group sequential stopping boundaries. While the statistical
         properties of each are completely understood separately, combining two well-understood
         design features does not add up to a well-understood design. For example, when the
         experimental therapy is performing better than control, the sample size may be increased
         due to the sample size re-estimation and the first interim analysis will be delayed.
         The trial may stop for success, though with additional patients and more time than
         it might require otherwise. Given that the experimental therapy is performing well,
         the additional patients and time could be undesirable. On the other hand, the delay
         could be considered small and worth the protection of power that the sample size re-estimation
         provides. Even with the simulation exercise presented here, the SHINE design is still
         not completely characterized because covariates and the adaptive randomization component
         are not included.

<section><a name="sec5"></a><h3>Conclusions</h3>
   <div class="collapsible-content">
      <p style="line-height:160%">The goal of this project was to illustrate two alternative real-world designs, the
         two primary designs considered for a multi-center NIH-funded randomized clinical trial.
         Because they are two real-world designs, simple head-to-head comparisons changing
         one feature at a time are not possible and the alternative trials must be judged on
         the totality of their operating characteristics.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The consideration of alternative trial designs was a successful venture in that two
         designs were brought forward, and both were evaluated, revised, and improved based
         on the input of all parties involved in the ADAPT-IT process. Simulation of an entire
         design as it will be conducted was necessary to evaluate the selected design features
         in concert with each other and to inform the study team of the gains/losses associated
         with various design choices. Trial simulation should not be reserved for only complex
         adaptive designs. Rather, all trialists should consider trial simulation an important
         tool for developing a complete understanding of the statistical properties of their
         trial design <a name="d81468e1540"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B14'); return false;" href="#B14">14</a>].
