               </div>
               <p>In the general population the prevalence of bipolar and schizophrenia is 0.24% and
                  1.4% respectively. People with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have a significantly
                  reduced life expectancy, increased rates of unemployment and a fear of stigma leading
                  to reduced self-confidence. A core outcome set is a standardised collection of items
                  that should be reported in all controlled trials within a research area. There are
                  currently no core outcome sets available for use in effectiveness trials involving
                  bipolar or schizophrenia service users managed in a community setting.

                  <h3>Methods</h3>
               </div>
               <p>A three-step approach is to be used to concurrently develop two core outcome sets,
                  one for bipolar and one for schizophrenia. First, a comprehensive list of outcomes
                  will be compiled through qualitative research and systematic searching of trial databases.
                  Focus groups and one-to-one interviews will be completed with service users, carers
                  and healthcare professionals. Second, a Delphi study will be used to reduce the lists
                  to a core set. The three-round Delphi study will ask service users to score the outcome
                  list for relevance. In round two stakeholders will only see the results of their group,
                  while in round three stakeholders will see the results of all stakeholder group by
                  stakeholder group. Third, a consensus meeting with stakeholders will be used to confirm
                  outcomes to be included in the core set. Following the development of the core set
                  a systematic literature review of existing measures will allow recommendations for
                  how the core outcomes should be measured and a stated preference survey will explore
                  the strength of people’s preferences and estimate weights for the outcomes that comprise
                  the core set.

               </div>
               <p>A core outcome set represents the minimum measurement requirement for a research area.
                  We aim to develop core outcome sets for use in research involving service users with
                  schizophrenia or bipolar managed in a community setting. This will inform the wider
                  PARTNERS2 study aims and objectives of developing an innovative primary care-based
                  model of collaborative care for people with a diagnosis of bipolar or schizophrenia.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Mental illness is the single largest cause of disability in the UK, contributing to
         22.8% of the total burden of disease 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. An evaluation of primary care service provision for severe mental illness (SMI)
         indicates that 94% of service users had a recorded diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar
         disorder 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. In the general population the prevalence of schizophrenia is up to 1.4% and for
         bipolar I disorder it is 0.24% 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>. People with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have a significantly reduced life
         expectancy, increased rates of unemployment and experience of stigma leading to reduced
         self-confidence and self-esteem 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>. The service cost alone of treating these diseases is estimated at £3.8 billion and
         expected to rise to £6.3 billion per year 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) can provide robust evidence to inform mental health
         and social care. Outcomes assessed in trials can help inform decisions regarding both
         individual care and policy formation at local, regional or national levels. To do
         this outcomes need to be relevant and of value to stakeholders, such as the services
         users, family, carers, health and social care professionals and decision makers.
      </p>
      <p>The use of numerous trial outcomes within the same research area can cause challenges.
         The most accessed and cited Cochrane reviews of 2009 all reported problems with heterogeneity
         of outcomes 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>. Within mental health research, trials frequently use a broad range of outcome measures.
         A recent survey of 10,000 RCTs in schizophrenia reported that 2,194 different measurements
         were used, with a new outcome being reported every fifth trial 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>. This has the potential to reduce the ability to synthesise results. Furthermore,
         many of the measures used in these trials have been selected by researchers and clinicians
         and may not reflect outcomes
         <sup>a</sup> that are relevant to all stakeholders.
      </p>
      <p>The use of numerous outcome measures within a controlled trial can also result in
         reporting bias. RCTs should specify 
         <i>a priori</i> the primary and secondary outcome measures to be used to test a study hypothesis
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span>. However, reporting bias occurs when the authors report a subsection of the outcome
         measures, based on the significance of the findings 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span>. Reporting bias has been shown to be a widespread phenomenon in medical literature
         generally 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">15</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span>, as well as in mental health specifically 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>These issues can be addressed through the use of a core outcome set with input from
         a range of stakeholders including service users with lived experience of SMI and carers.
         A core outcome set is a standardised collection of items that should be reported in
         all controlled trials within a research area

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
         </span>. Trialists are not restricted to these measures and can use additional measures to
         those in the core set. However, the core set marks the basic requirement of what outcomes
         need to be measured and reported.
      </p>
      <p>Core outcome sets for effectiveness trials involving service users with bipolar or
         schizophrenia, managed in a community setting, have the potential to reduce reporting
         bias and facilitate evidence synthesis. The assessment of similarities in outcomes
         between the two sets may allow the identification of common outcomes for use in SMI
         trials including both groups. Community setting refers to care or support received
         while living in the community (i.e. not in hospital as an in-patient). A search of
         the COMET database showed no core outcome sets are currently available for use in
         controlled trials recruiting adult participants with bipolar or schizophrenia, managed
         in a community setting.

      <p>The PARTNERS2 study has been funded through the NIHR under its Programme Grants for
         Applied Research programme (grant reference no. RP-PG-0611-20004). It aims to help
         primary care and community-based mental health services work more closely and efficiently
         together through developing and trialling an innovative primary care-based model of
         collaborative care for people with a diagnosis of bipolar and schizophrenia. Work
         commenced in March 2014 and is scheduled for completion in 2019.

         </div>
         <p>The aim of this study is to develop two individual core outcome sets for schizophrenia
            and bipolar for use in SMI trials involving adult service users recruited from a community
            setting. In addition, we will compare the two core outcome sets and identify common
            outcomes to be assessed in SMI trials including both groups (see Figure 
            <div tagx="figr">1</div>).

         </div>
         <p>The specific objectives are threefold. First, to identify a comprehensive list of
            outcomes that are relevant for trials involving schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
            in a community setting, to develop two core outcome sets based on this comprehensive
            list and, where possible, to identify common outcomes across core outcome sets. The
            second is to identify potential reliable, valid and responsive measures that could
            be used to assess the outcomes included in the core sets. A further objective is to
            estimate the strength of people’s preferences and weights for key outcomes/items included
            in the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) that comprise the core sets.

            <h3>Overview</h3>
         </div>
         <p>A three-step approach to concurrently developing each of the core outcome sets will
            be used 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
            </span>,
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
            </span>. First, a comprehensive list of outcomes relevant to stakeholders will be compiled
            through qualitative research and through a review of outcomes reported in existing
            trials. Focus groups and one-to-one interviews with key stakeholders will be used.
            Second, the comprehensive list will be reduced to a core outcome set through Delphi
            methodology. Third, a consensus meeting with stakeholders will confirm the outcomes
            to be included in the core sets.
         </p>
         <p>Two additional steps will then be completed. A systematic literature review of existing
            measures and a stakeholder discussion will allow recommendations as to how the core
            outcomes should be measured. Finally, a stated preference survey will explore the
            strength of people’s preferences and estimate weights for key outcomes/items included
            in the PROMs that comprise the core sets.
         </p>
         <p>Ethical approval for the study has been sought and granted from the National Research
            Ethics Service (NRES) West Midlands – Edgbaston (reference no. 14/WM/0052).

            <h3>Step 1: Qualitative research</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The opinions of key stakeholders will be sought using focus groups and one-to-one
            interviews. The qualitative methods will differ between stakeholder groups due to
            methodological and practical considerations, such as time pressures of healthcare
            professionals.

               <p>People with schizophrenia or bipolar who use community services to support their health
                  and well-being and their family members and carers will be purposively sampled by
                  age, gender, condition and geographical location. To be eligible for inclusion in
                  a focus group or interview service users must: self-identify as having a lifetime
                  or current clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar; be receiving treatment
                  in a community setting; be over 18 and under 65 years old and speak English. Carers
                  must be a self-reported carer of a person who meets the service user criteria and
                  speaks English.

                  <h5>Recruitment</h5>
               </div>
               <p>Recruitment will occur through NHS Trust clinics and via the third sector organisations,
                  such as MIND, National Survivor User Network (NSUN), Rethink Mental Illness, Bipolar
                  UK and Carers in Partnership. Initial contact will be via email, post and leaflets
                  and posters displayed in NHS clinics and third sector organisations. Interested participants
                  will be advised to contact the study team by post, email or phone. The study team
                  will check the eligibility and identify potential dates for participation. At this
                  point the research will be described in greater detail and potential participants
                  will be given the opportunity to ask questions. An invitation letter and an information
                  sheet will be sent to eligible participants that wish to participate. A reminder phone
                  call will be scheduled, or letter will be sent, in the week prior to the focus group.
                  For those participants preferring to take part in one-to-one interviews, these will
                  be arranged and a reminder phone call scheduled. For both focus groups and one-to-one
                  interviews informed consent will be taken prior to starting data collection.
               </p>
               <p>The number of service user and carer participants recruited to the study is dependent
                  on a number of factors: the proportion of the data gathered through focus groups as
                  opposed to one-to-one interviews
                  <sup>b</sup>, the size of the focus groups that are held and the point at which data saturation
                  is achieved. It is anticipated that roughly 24 service users (12 with each diagnosis)
                  and up to 10 carers will be recruited to the qualitative stage of the work.

                  <h5>Methodology</h5>
               </div>
               <p>Focus groups and one-to-one interviews will seek to identify clinical, social and
                  psychological outcomes that are important to service users and carers. Participants
                  will be encouraged to discuss the impact that their illness has upon them and their
                  life. They will be asked to explain how treatment or management of their illness affects
                  them. Participants will be encouraged to explore the important short- and long-term
                  impacts of treatment. A topic guide, developed in collaboration with a researcher
                  with lived experience of serious mental illness, will be used as an aide memoire and
                  to add structure to the discussion.
               </p>
               <p>Focus groups will be split by clinical diagnosis resulting in groups of bipolar service
                  users, bipolar carers, schizophrenia service users and schizophrenia carers. This
                  will allow identification of outcomes relevant to bipolar and schizophrenia service
                  users and any common outcomes across diagnoses.
               </p>
               <p>The consent process will be completed on the day of the focus group or interview,
                  before starting the discussion, in order to allow assessment of capacity to participate
                  on that day. Prior to the consent form being signed, participants will be asked if
                  they have read and understood the information provided to them and will have the opportunity
                  to ask any further questions. The audio recording of discussions, the anonymity process
                  and the ability of the participant to withdraw from the focus group at any point will
                  be verbally emphasised at the start.

               <p>Health and social care professionals will be recruited primarily from West-Midlands

               <p>Potential participants will be contacted via an email, containing a study information
                  sheet, requesting their participation in the study. A reminder email will be sent
                  2 weeks after the original email. Upon a positive reply from a potential participant
                  a date will be set for a telephone interview. A consent form will be sent to participants
                  via email upon agreeing to participate. Verbal consent will be taken and recorded
                  at the start of the interview and a request will be made for the participant to return

                  the conversation; however the semi-structured nature of the discussion will allow
                  emergent themes or pertinent points to be explored. Participants will be asked to
                  discuss how bipolar and schizophrenia affects a person’s life, how care and support
                  can improve outcomes that are important to the patient and what outcomes should be
                  assessed in research with these populations. One half of the interview will be given
                  to discussing bipolar and the other half to schizophrenia. The sequence in which the
                  conditions are discussed will be varied. Where a participant has particular expertise
                  in one condition the whole of the interview will be devoted to discussing that condition
                  (this is expected in a minority of cases).

            <p>Focus groups and one-to-one interviews will be digitally audio-recorded and transcribed
               verbatim. Transcripts will be coded using the computer-assisted qualitative data analysis
               software, such as Dedoose or Nvivo. The first version of the coding structure will
               be formed during the analysis of the early data and therefore grounded in the data.
               For the service user and carer data two researchers (one with and one without lived
               experience) will concurrently analyse all data. For the health and social care professional
               data the facilitator of the interviews will lead the analysis of data, with 20% checked
               for accuracy and completion by a researcher with lived experience of mental illness.

               groups to be explored in greater depths with later groups. The analysis will focus
               on forming a comprehensive list of outcomes that are important to stakeholders. The
               structure and length of this list will be dependent on the data.

            <p>During the qualitative analysis outcomes identified as relevant to schizophrenia and
               bipolar service users will be identified separately. Evidence of notable convergence
               in the outcomes in the two groups may indicate that in addition to the bipolar and
               schizophrenia core outcome sets, the potential for a joint core outcome set could
               be considered. Considerable difference in the outcomes at this stage would suggest
               that this is not a workable possibility.

         <p>A group of participants, representing the key stakeholder groups of service users,
            carers and health and social care professionals, will be recruited to the study. Those
            participating in the qualitative research will be invited to participate in the Delphi
            study. There is no consensus on the optimal sample size for a Delphi study; therefore
            recruitment is based on previous Delphi studies 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">27</span>
            </span> and will likely result in between 75 and 100 participants being recruited to the
            first round of the Delphi. Participants will be purposively sampled to ensure representation
            of all stakeholder groups; exact numbers will be informed by previous research 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">27</span>
            </span> and will be agreed upon in discussion with the steering committee and LEAP. The requirement
            for participants to complete all rounds of the Delphi study will be emphasised during
            the process of recruitment. To limit attrition appropriate procedures will be followed
            
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">

         </p>
         <p>Potential participants will be recruited from NHS trusts as well as through third
            sector organisations, including MIND, Bipolar UK, the McPin Foundation and NSUN. Healthcare
            professionals and individuals involved in research will be approached via an invitation
            email. Service users and carers will be recruited via email, post and leaflets and
            posters in NHS clinics and third sector organisations.

            </div>
            <p>In the first round participants will be asked to register online. The registration
               process will capture participants’ name, email addresses and additional participant
               information. Service users will be asked for their clinical diagnosis and the current
               state of health; carers will be asked for the same information of the person for which
               they care; healthcare professionals and commissioners will be asked for their professional
               role, seniority and clinical specialism. A unique identifier will be assigned to each
               participant to allow identification of individuals completing each round. A paper-based
               version of the survey will be available upon request.
            </p>
            <p>The list of outcomes identified through the qualitative research and review will be
               presented to participants. Participants will be asked to rate the importance of each
               of the outcomes on a nine-point Likert scale, one being not important and nine being
               critical. Through the use of a free text box participants will be able to provide
               feedback on their choices if they wish. Through inclusion of the following question
               participants will be able to propose additional outcomes that were not identified
               in the qualitative work: ‘Can you think of any additional outcomes that should be
               measured in research trials with bipolar/schizophrenia service users?’ A free text
               box will be available for participants to list additional outcomes.

            </div>
            <p>The response rate will be assessed at the end of round one. The total number of respondents
               completing the round will be assessed by stakeholder groups (service users, carers
               and healthcare professionals). The total number of respondents will be compared to
               the number of respondent who agreed to participate (to analyse attrition between recruitment
               and survey) and the number who registered at the start of the survey (to analyse within

            <p>If low numbers of responders are observed in one or more of the stakeholder groups
               the methodology of the Delphi study will be re-assessed. Potential changes include
               the re-opening of round one recruitment or an additional reminder message to non-responders.
               If low numbers are observed in one stakeholder group only, the potential of merging
               groups will be assessed and discussed with the LEAP and study management team. Such
               decisions will be made prior to viewing results from round one to minimise bias. The
               following protocol is based on the assumption of adequate respondent numbers.
            </p>
            <p>Data from round one will be analysed by stakeholder group. For each outcome, the number
               of respondents and distribution of scores will be summarised and analysed. Any additional
               information in a free text field will be considered by members of the study team and
               the LEAP to ensure they represent new outcomes not identified in previous qualitative
               work. If it is the case that they do represent a new outcome not already identified
               they will be included in round two.

               For each outcome the distribution of scores will be summarised. Each outcome will
               be classified as “consensus in”, “consensus out” and “no consensus” using the following
               classification: “Consensus in”, consensus that the outcome should be included in a
               core outcome set, will be defined as greater than 70% of participants scoring 7–9
               and less than 25% of participants scoring 1–3. “Consensus out”, consensus that the
               outcome should not be included in a core outcome set, will be defined as greater than
               70% of participants scoring 1–3 and less than 15% scoring 7–9. “No consensus” will
               be said to have occurred when any other distribution of scores occurs. Such classifications
               are somewhat arbitrary and subjective, however stipulating the ex-ante controls for
               bias and prior beliefs informing the analysis post-hoc. Where “no consensus” has occurred
               the outcome will undergo further analysis, including assessment of the mean score
               in the final round. The analysis will be summarised by stakeholder group and all participants
               and comparison will be drawn between groups. This analysis, for both bipolar and schizophrenia,
               will be presented to the consensus meeting.

         <p>On completion of the Delphi Study a face-to-face consensus meeting will be held with
            key stakeholders, including some members of the LEAP. The results of each round of
            the Delphi study will be presented to the meeting, with the consensus results from
            the round three analyses used as the starting point for discussion. The final format

            <h3>Step 5: Stated preference survey</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The key patient outcomes to be compared and explored in the stated preference survey
            will be defined from the evidence identified in steps 1–4 above. It may be that the
            work in stages 1–4 identifies one outcome and associated outcome measure that is considered
            the primary outcome for both people with schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder. In
            this case, the stated preference survey will be designed to estimate the preferences
            of service users, carers and relevant healthcare professionals and policy makers for
            key domains of that outcome measure. However, there may be a number of outcomes that
            are identified as important. In this case the stated preference attributes and levels
            will be developed from the results of stage 1–4 and refined by discussions with the
            LEAP and study team. LEAP participants will also be asked to participate in a pilot
            of the survey measure.
         </p>
         <p>Service users, carers and relevant health and social care professionals and commissioners
            will be asked to complete the stated preference survey to identify their preferences
            and priorities for the different types of outcomes identified as important to measure
            in the core set. The participants will be drawn from the focus groups and Delphi panels.
         </p>
         <p>The stated preference survey will use orthogonal main effects. Responses from the
            questionnaires will be analysed using appropriate logistic or probit regression analyses.
            The coefficients for each attribute will indicate the direction of preference for
            that attribute. Marginal rates of substitution will be calculated to estimate the
            relative utility of the attribute. These analyses will be used to:
         </p>
         <p>(1) explore the relative importance and preference for different aspects of outcome
            included in the core set (or primary outcome) and
         </p>
         <p>(2) estimate preference weights that can be used to combine key domains into a single

         <h2>Discussion/conclusion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>A core outcome set represents the minimum measurement requirement for a research area.
         Studies within that area which are focussed on a sub-set of service users, for example
         rapid cycling bipolar, or focussed on specific area, for example collaborative care,
         may feel the requirement to supplement the a core outcome set with additional, relevant
         measures assessing different outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>This protocol has a number of strengths, including the commitment to ensuring service
         users and carers are represented, using qualitative work to identify outcomes that
         may not currently be used in research and following best practice developed through
         the COMET initiative. Some potential limitations of this work should be highlighted.
         The requirement of service users and carers to self-identify could induce bias or
         inaccuracy. The use of an online Delphi survey will limit participation to those who
         are computer literate and the qualitative work cannot include those who do not have
         a conversational level of spoken English. Reasonable steps will be taken to minimise
         the impact of these limitations upon the work and they will be reflected upon when
         presenting findings.
      </p>
      <p>There are no core outcome sets for use in research involving service users with schizophrenia
         or bipolar managed in a community setting. The PARTNERS2 project aims to develop core
         outcome sets for these research areas by drawing on outcomes identified as important
         by relevant stakeholders and using the expertise of our LEAP. Given that 94% of diagnoses
         for SMI in primary care were for bipolar or schizophrenia we anticipate that it is
         likely that there will be some degree of convergence between the two sets developed
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. The potential of developing one core outcome set for use in SMI research in a community
         setting will be continually assessed throughout this work. It is anticipated that
         successful completion of this work will improve the ability of future research to
         draw comparison between studies involving people with schizophrenia and bipolar and
         improve interpretation of results. The challenges of developing a COS in this area
         and with this population will be discussed and subsequent weaknesses of the research
         will be highlighted.
