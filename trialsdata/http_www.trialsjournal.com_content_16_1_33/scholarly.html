                  <h3>Background</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Young breast cancer survivors (aged 50 years and under) and their partners are at
                  an elevated risk for relationship distress and poor psychological adjustment relative
                  to older age couples. Limited availability of time and resources and the distance
                  to travel are major barriers to engaging in evidence-based psychosocial support programs.
                  This paper describes the study protocol of a novel, manualized online intervention
                  called Couplelinks that was developed to improve relationship adjustment and psychological
                  wellbeing of young couples affected by breast cancer. Couplelinks is a custom-designed
                  website offering a professionally facilitated, couple-centered intervention that entails
                  informational, experiential, and interactive components.

                  <h3>Methods/Design</h3>
               </div>
               <p>A total of 80 heterosexual couples from across Canada in which the female partner
                  has been diagnosed with a primary breast cancer will be recruited and randomized to
                  a treatment or waitlist control group. Six dyadic learning modules form the core of
                  the program and will be undertaken on a weekly basis. The manualized online intervention
                  involves psycho-education and experiential exercises to enhance communication, coping
                  ability, mutual empathy, and perspective-taking in relation to cancer. An online facilitator
                  who is a trained mental health professional will guide and support couples throughout
                  the process. Data collection will occur at baseline, at post-treatment or eight weeks
                  into the waiting period, and at the three-month follow-up assessment. Primary outcome
                  measures include the Revised Dyadic Adjustment Survey (RDAS) and Dyadic Coping Inventory
                  (DCI) scores, and secondary outcome measures include the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
                  Survey (HADS) score.

                  <h3>Discussion</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Couplelinks is one of the first internet-based psychological interventions to improve
                  the psychosocial adjustment of couples coping with a life-threatening illness such
                  as cancer. If successful, the design of this program as described in this paper makes
                  a valuable contribution to the literature on the delivery of couple-focused psychosocial
                  interventions, both within and outside of oncology.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Women aged 50 years and under account for only 18% of newly diagnosed breast cancer
         (BC) cases 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>, yet they experience significantly greater levels of cancer-related distress and
         poorer quality of life relative to women diagnosed later in life 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>. Population-based age cohort studies have found that younger women are at greater
         risk for experiencing functional declines in physical, social, and psychological domains
         for as long as 10 years post-cancer treatment 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>. Younger women also suffer significantly greater levels of depression, anxiety, and
         fears that the cancer will recur 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span>. Chemotherapy-induced menopause among younger women is related to greater sexual
         difficulties and physical symptoms than if menopause occurred prior to cancer diagnosis
         and treatment 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Such age-related discrepancies in BC patients’ adjustment to the illness are in part
         related to the abrupt and developmentally premature physical and social changes associated
         with the diagnosis and treatment of cancer that most older women have either already
         come to terms with, or for whom such changes are no longer relevant. These unique
         challenges may include: the loss of fertility and therefore a loss of the choice to
         conceive children 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>; concerns about their ability to adequately care for, and address, the needs of their
         young children, and how to communicate with them about the illness in a way that is
         appropriate to the child’s developmental stage

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
         </span>. Financial strains as a result of taking time off work for treatment or out-of-pocket
         expenses for childcare and/or housekeeping, and the increase in expenses due to treatment
         are particularly problematic for younger couples whose full income potential may not
         yet be realized 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
         </span>. Moreover, social comparison processes with similarly aged peers increase the salience
         of these losses for younger women for whom the illness is ‘off-time’ developmentally
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

      </p>
      <p>Although the quality of general social support helps mitigate much of younger BC patients’
         distress 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">23</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">24</span>
         </span>, the support from an intimate partner is particularly important to women’s adjustment

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">25</span>
         </span>. Stressors that couples commonly contend with include: renegotiation of family roles
         and responsibilities, for instance, the well partner may take on additional responsibilities
         in various areas such as childcare 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">26</span>
         </span>; feelings of inequity, for instance, caregivers may feel as though they are taking
         on a disproportionately greater amount of work in the relationship, or the patient
         may experience guilt over not being able to contribute to the relationship as before
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">27</span>
         </span>; reduced sexual engagement and social activity

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

         </span>. Such challenges may be even more pronounced for younger couples. For example, declines
         in sexual engagement may be intensified as a result of premature menopause and related
         loss of libido, vaginal dryness, and painful intercourse 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">33</span>

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">34</span>
         </span>. Moreover, younger couples’ relationships are likely less resilient to stressors
         such as BC as older couples, relative to younger couples, are more likely to have
         a better understanding of each other, and by virtue of having already experienced
         hardships together, are more likely to have established collaborative coping skills

            <h3>Rationale for online couple based intervention</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Given the wealth of research highlighting the interdependency of partners’ distress
            and coping on their subsequent adjustment to cancer, psychosocial interventions that
            are couple-focused have been recommended (for examples, see 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
            </span>,
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">51</span>
            </span>,
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">52</span>
            </span>), particularly for younger couples who are more vulnerable to distress and poorer
            quality of life 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
            </span>,
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
            </span>,
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">33</span>
            </span>. While conventional couple interventions have demonstrated efficacy in reducing distress
            for couples coping with breast cancer 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">53</span>
            </span>-
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">57</span>
            </span>, they may not be a feasible option for younger couples who are already living very
            busy lives with additional demands, such as caring for young children and balancing
            domestic duties and active careers alongside attending medical appointments. Indeed,
            studies have found that the primary reasons breast cancer patients and their partners
            do not participate in or complete couple-focused psychosocial interventions are limited
            time, distance, and lack of willingness to travel 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">57</span>
            </span>,
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">58</span>
            </span>. Furthermore, traditional counselling approaches may not adequately address the unique
            and complex needs of younger BC couples.
         </p>
         <p>The present paper describes an innovative, online psycho-educational intervention
            currently under investigation that addresses the void in the psychosocial support
            available to younger couples facing a breast cancer diagnosis. This intervention,
            which is tailored specifically to this group’s unique needs, is delivered through
            a custom-designed website called ‘Couplelinks.ca’. Couplelinks provides a professionally
            facilitated, couple-centered intervention that includes informational, experiential,
            and interactive components. Given the numerous barriers to younger couples’ engagement
            in psychosocial services, an online relationship enhancement intervention that is
            both accessible and flexibly delivered offers a compelling alternative to conventional
            counselling.
         </p>
         <p>Most online psychosocial interventions currently available for breast cancer patients
            are support groups that interact via virtual discussion boards 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">59</span>
            </span>-
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">63</span>
            </span>. Participation in internet-based support groups has been associated with reductions
            in social isolation, depression, and cancer-related trauma, and increased feelings
            of personal empowerment and self-esteem 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">62</span>
            </span>,
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">64</span>

            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">70</span>
            </span>. Such outcomes have, for example, been demonstrated in a Canada-wide initiative,
            ‘CancerChatCanada’, to offer professionally facilitated group support to individuals
            affected by cancer through a secure, online platform 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">71</span>
            </span>. Each group employs real-time (synchronous), text-based communication as the medium
            for group interaction, and is structured like a face-to-face support group, with approximately
            eight group members and a group leader 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">72</span>
            </span>. Asynchronous groups using bulletin board technology that are moderated by a mental
            health professional have similarly shown beneficial effects for cancer patients (for
            examples, see 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">59</span>

            <span tagx="abbrgrp">

            </span>).
         </p>
         <p>The Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) is another example of
            a successful online support program for people affected by cancer. The service was
            originally developed for breast cancer patients, but has more recently been studied
            with other populations such as the medically underserved and/or economically disadvantaged
            sub-groups of BC patients 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">73</span>
            </span>,
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">74</span>
            </span>, and caregivers to lung cancer patients 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">75</span>
            </span>. CHESS provides an online platform where women with BC have access to health monitoring
            and decision-making tools, and can ask questions of health professionals as well as
            provide and receive emotional and informational support from other BC survivors 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">75</span>
            </span>. Such programs provide BC survivors with cancer-specific education to help with treatment-related
            decisions, as well as managing physical and psychological symptoms. The site also
            offers opportunities for social bonding with others facing similar experiences.
         </p>
         <p>Apart from greater access to professional support, the online modality allows for
            flexibility in terms of time, and has the added benefit of overcoming various other
            barriers to accessing psychosocial support, such as childcare and transportation issues
            
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">61</span>

            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">77</span>
            </span>. Studies have found that younger women with breast cancer demonstrate a strong preference
            for receiving psychosocial support via online programs 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">78</span>
            </span>, and that men are more inclined to open up about their feelings and discuss sensitive
            information in relation to cancer in an online versus face-to-face context 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">60</span>
            </span>. Younger men in particular have shown reluctance to make use of conventional forms
            of psychosocial support (such as counselling services) as it may conflict with their
            self-concept and notions of strength and self-reliance 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">79</span>
            </span>-
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">81</span>
            </span>.
         </p>
         <p>Taken together, these findings suggest that the internet would be a very promising
            modality through which to offer support to younger women with breast cancer and their
            partners. Couplelinks aims to build on the success of previous online support programs
            for individuals with cancer by: (1) targeting couples (versus individuals), (2) addressing
            the specific psychological and informational needs of younger women with BC and their
            partners, and (3) combining didactic learning with experiential learning on topics
            relevant to coping with BC as a younger couple.

            </div>
            <p>The structure and content of Couplelinks was derived based on theory and empirical
               evidence that couples who construe the illness as a shared problem (not something
               ‘belonging’ to the ill partner) are better able to engage in mutually supportive interactions
               that promote their adjustment 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">82</span>

                  <span tagx="abbr">85</span>
               </span>. Enhancing partners’ sense of ‘we-ness’ in relation to breast cancer as a means for
               alleviating distress is grounded theoretically in the work of Reid 
               <i>et al</i>. and Fergus 
               <i>et al</i>. 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">82</span>
               </span>,
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">83</span>
               </span>,
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">86</span>
               </span>-
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">88</span>
               </span>. Their framework for understanding and treating distressed relationships integrates
               family systems and constructivist theory pertaining to how partners make meaning,
               and how such meaning-making processes influence their interpersonal dynamic. Within
               this framework, the more partners construe themselves as being part of their relationship,
               also referred to as couple identity or we-ness, the greater their overall relationship
               resilience 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">83</span>

                  <span tagx="abbr">87</span>
               </span>. Adopting a we-oriented approach to coping (also known as ‘we-coping’

                  <span tagx="abbr">91</span>
               </span>) accomplishes several things. Firstly, it mitigates the potential for either partner
               to feel isolated and alone in his or her coping. It also de-centers the couple and
               the greater relationship from the illness, countering the tendency for the relationship
               to become defined by the losses and stressors associated with BC. Lastly, in creating
               an adaptive separation between the couple and the illness, the couple is afforded
               the distance and greater perspective necessary to discuss the illness constructively
               and problem-solve around it 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">92</span>
               </span>.
            </p>
            <p>When partners adopt a ‘we’ attitude in relation to cancer (seeing it as ‘our’ problem
               rather than hers alone) their individual coping efforts are coordinated with each
               other, allowing them to better manage the stress related to the illness. Both partners
               are likely to express their needs to the other, and be able to request and receive

               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">85</span>
               </span> developmental model of couple adaptation to illness and specifically, the disruptions
               experienced by younger couples when age appropriate goals and milestones (such as
               having a child) are impeded because of the illness and the long-term consequences
               of treatment (such as premature menopause and infertility); and (2) Gottman’s 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">96</span>
               </span> well-validated theory of healthy relationship functioning and interaction patterns
               that promote relationship adjustment, such as having a higher ratio of positive-to-negative
               interactions (and correspondingly, positive-to-negative affect) in the relationship,
               or having an accurate understanding of one’s partner’s thoughts and feelings, and
               broader goals, dreams, and preferences.
            </p>
            <p>Theoretical integration of these frameworks supports the overall objectives of the
               Couplelinks intervention, which are to: (1) enhance couple’s sense of we-ness as a
               means to better enabling partners to manage stressors associated with BC; and (2)
               facilitate partners’ making meaning of the experience of BC in a way that draws them
               closer together, despite the emotional hardship, losses, and grief experienced due
               to the illness. These goals are achieved by progressively guiding the couple through
               exercises designed to foster empathy, perspective-taking, constructive communication
               and listening skills, emotional and physical intimacy, and positive affect in the
               relationship. By foregrounding we-ness relative to the illness, the couple is in a
               better position to externalize BC and experience themselves as an ‘us’ in relation
               to ‘it’. While the couple engages in exercises intended to support one another within
               the relationship, BC is integrated into each learning module as both a current stressor
               whose impact on each partner needs to be accurately understood and acknowledged, and
               a topic or problem to be collectively addressed.

            <h3>Phase I: pilot research</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The content and design of Couplelinks is entirely original and was developed by members
            of the research team in consultation with an advisory committee comprised of couples
            with a history of BC and stakeholders in the BC community. The content and functionality
            was developed to address the needs and concerns specific to younger breast cancer
            couples. Couplelinks was designed to be informative, engaging, and interactive. In
            the phase I trial, the intervention was pilot-tested using a non-randomized, pre-post
            test design to assess whether couples found the website easy to navigate and use,
            the website content to be clear and coherent as well as informative about couples
            coping with BC, and the program convenient, flexible, and enjoyable (as intended)
            
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">97</span>
            </span>. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of measures assessing treatment satisfaction
            and perceived benefits from 10 couples that completed phase I suggested that the aforementioned
            objectives were being met. The majority of participants reported that they found the
            program easy to use, convenient, and beneficial in that it provided a safe and structured
            opportunity to discuss difficult topics in relation to cancer that, for many participants,
            had been avoided or simply not addressed prior to the program. Feedback from phase
            I trial couples on the website functionality and program informed improvements to
            the intervention and website. The improved, second iteration of the intervention is
            being tested in a phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) currently underway across
            Canada and is described in this paper.

            <h3>Intervention protocol</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Six experiential, dyadic learning modules (DLMs) that form the core of the program
            (with an optional seventh module) are undertaken by the couple on a weekly basis in
            consultation with a Couplelinks facilitator.

               <h4>Dyadic learning modules</h4>
            </div>
            <p>Each module is designed to teach a different relationship principle. The basic structure
               of every DLM is as follows: (1) description of a basic relationship skill with examples;
               (2) exercises partners are asked to engage in so that they can learn the skills experientially;
               and (3) discussion between partners of what they learned followed by logging reflections
               and feedback about the exercise (see Table 
               <span tagx="tblr">1</span> for a description of each module and its objectives). The exercise and feedback components
               involve logging thoughts, observations, and reflections online that provide both the
               interactive learning for the couple, as well as information for the facilitator to
               respond to. For instance, module three, ‘Creating Connection’, focuses on helping
               partners increase positive interactions relative to negative interactions and is based
               on marital research that includes the work of Gottman 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">96</span>
               </span> which found that healthier relationships tend to demonstrate a greater ratio of positive
               to negative interactions. In module three, the difference between supportive and unsupportive
               behaviors and their impact on relationship quality is explained, and then partners
               are asked to observe and log during the week their partner’s ‘bids’ for support and
               to observe and describe their own ‘turning towards’ and ‘turning away’ behaviors from
               their partner. All modules from phase I were retained in phase III with the exception
               of module five from phase I, a listening skills module, that was changed to an optional
               seventh module in phase III based on feedback from the pilot study. Module five has
               been replaced by a module that focuses on rebuilding physical intimacy, a change made
               in response to feedback from couples in the pilot phase looking for help with restoring
               the sexual wellbeing of their relationship, which is often negatively affected by
               cancer treatment and the stress of the illness in general.

            <p>Couples are asked to undertake each module on a weekly basis and adhere to a six to
               eight-week timeframe. This timeline is reasonable based on our pilot work where we
               found that couples took approximately eight weeks on average to complete the six modules
               after taking into consideration vacations or unexpected interruptions. The modules
               are consecutive and cumulative with subsequent modules building upon knowledge and
               skills acquired through previous ones. Couples only gain access to the next module
               once the previous module has been completed. Access to subsequent modules is granted
               by the facilitator who first reviews and provides feedback to the couples as described
               below.

                  <h5>The Couplelinks facilitator</h5>
               </div>
               <p>Each couple in the treatment group is linked with a facilitator with whom they regularly
                  interact as they proceed through the modules. Interactions with the facilitator predominantly
                  occur through the Couplelinks website ‘Dialogue Room’ (DR). The DR is an asynchronous
                  (facilitator and couple are not online simultaneously) communication platform that
                  utilizes bulletin board technology to enable each partner to correspond directly with
                  their facilitator, as well as with one another, as they progress through the program.
                  Additionally, the facilitator has two pre-arranged phone ‘check-ins’ after module
                  two and four. Each time a couple completes a module their facilitator is notified
                  by an automatically generated email from the website. After reviewing each partner’s
                  online reflections and feedback about the module, the facilitator provides the couple
                  with feedback via the DR in order to validate their insights and new learning, acknowledge
                  any challenges or difficulties they may have experienced, and explain the objectives
                  of the subsequent module and, where applicable, how it builds on previous themes arising
                  for the couple. At this point the facilitator grants the couple access to the next
                  module. Couples also use the DR, for example, to ask questions about the program,
                  to update the facilitator on their progress, or to inform the facilitator of any events
                  that will conflict with an upcoming due date. The facilitator is also available for
                  additional telephone consultations as necessary; however, the pilot study showed such
                  consultations to be rare and, when undertaken, usually done to resolve minor technical
                  issues.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>There will be a total of five mental health professionals with experience in psycho-oncology
               with a range of disciplinary backgrounds (psychology, nursing, and social work) serving
               as Couplelinks facilitators. The current facilitators have been instrumental in developing
               this novel form of support and/or are well versed in the principles and techniques
               of providing Couplelinks facilitation as detailed in the Couplelinks program facilitation
               manual 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">98</span>
               </span>. In addition to studying the manual, newer members of the facilitation team receive
               individualized coaching and instruction on how to offer the intervention through ‘role
               play’ with a trainer (a clinician member of the research team), who acts as a ‘dummy’
               couple, progressing through each DLM and interacting online with the training facilitator
               as an actual couple would.
            </p>
            <p>The program facilitation manual describes in depth the guiding principles for online
               facilitation for the program overall, and for each of the seven DLMs. It also provides
               numerous examples of text-based feedback to each module, including facilitator responses
               to various challenges that may occur, such as a couple whose participation is interrupted
               due to investigation of a new, concerning symptom. All facilitators are individually
               supervised by either the first or second author (KF and SA) which includes an ongoing
               review of their interactions with active couples as logged and visible in the back-end
               of the Couplelinks interface (described below). All facilitators also attend regular
               peer supervision teleconference meetings led by the first and second author. Together,
               both forms of supervision ensure treatment fidelity; that facilitators adhere closely
               to the principles of online facilitation as articulated in the Couplelinks manual
               and maintain consistency in their method of facilitation. Which of the five facilitators
               a couple is assigned to will depend on whether or not the facilitator has space in
               his or her caseload, the facilitator’s discipline, and the corresponding regulating
               body’s stance on inter-jurisdictional practices. For instance, a clinical counsellor
               licensed in British Columbia may serve couples from other provinces, while a psychologist
               licensed to practice in Ontario cannot facilitate couples who reside outside of his
               or her geographic jurisdiction.

            <h3>Front-end user interface</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Every detail of the website, from its ‘look and feel’ to the content, was conceived
            with an eye toward being inclusive of both genders, clear and easy to follow, and
            engaging and enjoyable. The homepage includes an introductory video introducing the
            facilitator. Additionally, each DLM has its own corresponding home page and a video
            interview of a couple from the phase I trial of Couplelinks sharing their thoughts
            and reflections on that specific DLM. Another important consideration in the design
            of the intervention was that it be convenient and adaptable to the demanding schedules
            of younger couples. Pilot testing indicated that each module takes, on average, one
            hour in total to complete. In order to assist with planning and time management, an
            automated scheduler called the ‘Lesson Tracker’ that lists each module, its constituent
            steps, and estimated time for completion was introduced in the phase III version of
            the website and located on the homepage. Each time one step of a module is completed
            it registers automatically in the Lesson Tracker. Partners’ work is saved and they
            can log back in at a later time and use the Lesson Tracker to locate where they left
            off. Several optional readings are available on the Couplelinks website that focus
            on concerns most relevant to younger couples dealing with BC, and relational coping
            including fertility after BC, coping with premature menopause, sexuality and intimacy
            during and after treatment, parenting through breast cancer, and living with uncertainty
            and fears for the future. As not all topics pertain to each couple, there are no required
            readings.

         </div>
         <p>There is an administrative back-end to Couplelinks with different levels of access
            for each member of the Couplelinks team. The facilitators have access to the module
            data for the couples they are directly working with, and a ‘contact notes’ section
            to communicate with the research team overseeing the project. The facilitator uses
            the administrative interface to review a given couple’s progress on modules and their
            feedback, as well as to advance the couple to the next module. Additionally, facilitators
            can log contact notes to describe all interactions that occur outside the Couplelinks
            website, such as the phone call check-ins or emails that may have been exchanged due
            to difficulty with the website. The research coordinator ((RC) co-author, AP) and
            two clinician scientists (KF and SA) who are in charge of overseeing timely completion
            of modules and supervising facilitators have access to all outcome measure responses,
            facilitator contact notes, and all entries logged by all participants as they progress
            through each DLM.

            <h3>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The RC completes an eligibility screen with interested participants. Eligible couples
            are those in which the woman has received a diagnosis within the last 36 months of
            invasive breast carcinoma (non-metastatic), or ductal carcinoma 
            <i>in-situ</i>, at or before the age of 50 years. While we did not have specific criteria for stage
            of cancer treatment, we inform potential participants when they contact the RC for
            information about the project that it is probably best to begin at or nearing the
            end of active treatment. Feedback from phase I suggested that participants are more
            inclined to participate at this stage, and this finding is supported by evidence indicating
            that couples are often more vulnerable to experiencing conflict at this time due to
            differing expectations around recovery from BC 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">47</span>
            </span>. Couples must be in a committed, heterosexual relationship (for example, married,
            cohabitating, engaged, or steadily dating for at least six months at the time of participation).
            Both partners must fluently read and write in English and have access to a computer
            with a reliable internet connection.
         </p>
         <p>Couples are excluded from the study at the eligibility screening stage if: (1) either
            partner self-reports current suicidal ideation and/or attempts, or a diagnosis of
            a serious and currently active mental illness such as psychotic disorders, bipolar
            disorder, depression, or substance abuse that is not being successfully managed with
            psychiatric treatment, and therefore may potentially interfere with his or her capacity
            to benefit from the program; (2) the couple is either currently in couple counselling
            or expresses the intent to undertake counselling during the five-month study period;
            (3) one or both partners self-report interpersonal violence. If it becomes evident
            at any point over the course of the couple’s involvement in the program that their
            relationship distress is so significant that they would not benefit from the program,
            or their participation is significantly exacerbating rather than mitigating their
            distress, they are asked to discontinue the project and are referred to a face-to-face
            couple’s counsellor.

         <p>Eligible patients from across Canada and their partners are being identified and informed
            about the study by their health care providers at collaborating institutions in Ontario,
            Nova Scotia, Manitoba, and British Columbia. In our pilot study, we found that active
            forms of recruitment enhanced enrolment. Patients who have been approached by their
            health care provider and express an interest in learning more about the program are
            asked for consent to have their contact information forwarded to the RC, who then
            follows up with the potential participant by phone to provide her (or him) with information
            about the program. Additionally, flyers are displayed across various hospitals and
            cancer agencies. Announcements have been made at hospital meetings, BC support groups,
            and community cancer related workshops for young women. The advertisement is posted
            on websites commonly accessed by young women with BC, social media, and the Couplelinks
            informational webpage that is linked to these.

         <div tagx="st">
            <h3>Procedure</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Once a potential participant (typically the patient rather than the well partner)
            connects with the RC, she is informed about the nature of the project. This potential
            participant is asked to discuss the project with her partner and, if both are interested,
            the RC proceeds with scheduling a phone interview with each partner separately to
            confirm whether they both meet eligibility criteria. When screening couples, in addition
            to the inclusion and exclusion criteria previously described, the RC assesses partners’
            access to, and comfort with, the internet and whether they are likely to be able to
            keep up with the weekly time commitment for the program. Partners who anticipate interruptions
            (for instance due to travel) for a duration longer than two weeks are asked to delay
            enrolment until after they return. To avoid the confounding effects of other interventions,
            couples are informed of the expectation that they refrain from participating in couple-related
            psychosocial interventions until they have completed the five-month study term.
         </p>
         <p>If both participants meet the eligibility criteria, the RC proceeds with the informed
            consent process over the phone, which includes reviewing the objectives of the study,
            requirements of the participants, how their information will remain confidential,
            and participants’ right to withdraw at any time. Any concerns or questions are addressed
            and if the couple is satisfied, they are told they will be mailed a hard copy of the
            consent form that we request they review, sign, and return and that they may contact
            the RC again if they have any further questions. Once the signed informed consent
            form is received, the couples are randomized to the waitlist or intervention condition.
         </p>
         <p>Next, each partner is separately emailed a unique personal login ID and password which
            they use to complete all questionnaires, starting with the baseline questionnaires.
            The couples in the treatment group complete additional questionnaires as described
            in the measurement section below. Participants are informed that their responses to
            the surveys will not be shared with their partner, and they are instructed to complete
            the surveys without consulting one another. Once the time one (T1) measures are completed,
            the RC informs participants of their group assignment. Participants assigned to the
            treatment group are informed of the name of their Couplelinks facilitator. The facilitator
            schedules a phone meeting with the couple to introduce her or himself, clarify expectations
            of participants, answer questions, and review important information about the website
            and the intervention. The facilitator then sends the couple their login instructions
            via email.
         </p>
         <p>Both groups of participants complete standardized questionnaires online at T1, time
            two ((T2) at post-treatment for treatment and for waitlist groups, taking place eight
            weeks after T1), and time three ((T3) three months after completion of T2 measures).
            Participants in the treatment group are also asked to complete a post-treatment interview
            at T2. Couples in the waitlist group are given the option of receiving the intervention
            once they have completed the T3 questionnaires; if they choose to participate in the
            intervention, their completed T3 questionnaires will be used as their  pre-treatment
            (baseline) measurement, and they will be asked to complete surveys at post-treatment
            and one last time 3 months after posttreatment.

            <h3>Measurement</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The primary outcome of this study is improvement in relationship adjustment and dyadic
            coping. Secondary outcomes include improvement in mood (for example, anxiety or depression)
            and interpersonal communication. Self-reported socio-demographic variables are collected
            at T1 including: gender, age, ethnicity, education, employment status, relationship
            status, living arrangement, and number and gender of children. Self-reported disease
            and treatment information includes cancer stage, treatments received, status of treatment,
            and other health conditions. The assessment of the intervention’s effectiveness incorporates
            the effects of attrition and non-compliance into the analyses. Satisfaction with the
            intervention is assessed using a self-report questionnaire designed specifically for
            this study, and feedback for further improvements is obtained using a phone interview
            completed post-treatment. See Figure

         <p>The Revised Dyadic Adjustment Survey (RDAS) 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">99</span>
            </span> is an abbreviated version of the longer and widely used Dyadic Adjustment Survey
            (DAS) 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">100</span>
            </span>, with comparable levels of reliability and validity. This 14-item measure assesses
            dyadic consensus, cohesion, and satisfaction. The Kansas Marital Satisfaction Scale
            (KMSS) 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">101</span>
            </span> is one of the most commonly used global measures of marital satisfaction. It is comprised
            of three items on a seven-point Likert scale, asking respondents to identify their
            level of satisfaction with their partner, their marriage, and their relationship with
            their partner. Both the RDAS and the KMSS have demonstrated reliability and validity,
            and empirically derived cut-offs to differentiate between samples of couples being
            seen for couple intervention versus a community sample. The marital adjustment subscale
            of the Maudsley Marital Questionnaire (MMQ) 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">102</span>
            </span> evaluates an individual’s satisfaction with his or her committed or married relationship.
            It has 10-items, each rated on a nine-point scale.

         <p>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">103</span>
            </span> is a 14-item four-point Likert scale measure that includes two subscales of seven
            items each, assessing anxiety and depression. It is a simple yet reliable and valid
            tool to assess the presence of a mood disorder in medical settings. Although developed
            for a hospital-based population, it has also been found to be a valid screening instrument
            for depression and anxiety in the general population

            </span>. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) - Physical Well-Being
            (PWB) 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">105</span>
            </span> subscale is part of the widely used FACT-B that assesses quality of life among breast
            cancer patients. The PWB, a seven-item five-point Likert scale measuring physical
            functioning, is completed by the female partner only. This variable will be tested
            as a potential covariate. The Breast Cancer and Relationship Measure (BCRM) was developed
            by the study authors for this protocol to assess the degree to which partners experience
            breast cancer to have negatively affected their relationship. The scale has 10 items
            which participants rate on a scale from 0 (not at all) to nine (very much) depending
            on the degree to which each statement applies to them. An example item is ‘We are
            able to discuss difficult or sensitive issues related to breast cancer’.
         </p>
         <p>The Dyadic Coping Inventory (DCI) 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">106</span>
            </span> is a 37-item questionnaire that measures levels of stress-related communication and
            levels of supportive and negative dyadic coping behaviors when one or both partners
            are stressed, as well as perception of one’s partner’s stress-related communication
            and support. The scale consists of seven subscales, with four measuring self and partner
            stress communication, and supportive, negative, and joint dyadic coping. Additionally,
            two items capture the quality of the self-perceived level of overall dyadic coping.
            The Credibility Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">107</span>
            </span> is a six-item survey that assesses the participants’ expectations about how beneficial
            they believe the treatment will be, and how reasonable it is in their view that the
            treatment will address their problem. The questionnaire consists of two parts to evaluate
            such expectations and perceptions, with one part asking participants to answer the
            questions based on their rational thought process, and the other section in which
            they are asked to answer based on their emotions. The original measure assessed changes
            in trauma symptoms. The wording of the measure in this study refers to changes in
            relationship adjustment. This measure is administered to the treatment group at T1
            only.
         </p>
         <p>The System Usability Scale (SUS) 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">108</span>
            </span> is a 10-item measure designed to capture the participant’s subjective, global perspective
            of the website’s usability, including the website complexity and the perceived need
            for support or training. This measure is administered to the intervention group at
            T2 only. The Treatment Satisfaction Survey (TSS) measure was developed specifically
            for this study and assesses the satisfaction of participants in the intervention group
            with the program overall and specific aspects of it (for example convenience and facilitator
            role). In addition to items requiring quantitative ratings, open-ended questions are
            asked regarding the general experience, the program’s perceived benefits, and areas
            for improvement. The purpose of this measure is to obtain feedback regarding different
            facets of Couplelinks, in order to inform program development and determine participants’
            perceptions regarding the effective and less effective aspects of program experience.
            This measure is administered once at T2 to the intervention group. After completing
            the T2 questionnaires, a semi-structured interview designed specifically for this
            study is conducted over the phone with couples in the intervention group to get more
            detailed feedback about the intervention. Both partners are interviewed together and
            the interview takes 40-60 minutes.

            <h3>Sample size estimation and data analyses plan</h3>
         </div>
         <p>All scale and subscale means and standard deviations will be computed and summarized.
            The primary hypotheses to be tested are that the degree of change or improvement between
            T1 and T2 on the RDAS, KMSS, MMQ, and DCI summary scales will be greater for the treatment
            group relative to the waitlist group. Given that data are non-independent (measurements
            are of individuals that belong to the same dyad and multiple measures are taken per
            individual across time) the hypotheses will be evaluated using multilevel models (MLM)
            
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">109</span>
            </span>. MLM will allow for testing correlations between partners’ outcomes and whether there
            are differences in treatment effect for the patient versus her partner. The models
            will also be used to evaluate the degree of sustained change from T2 to T3, and whether
            treatment effects vary by severity of disease, age, and/or length of relationship,
            as well as aspects of the intervention such as level of engagement. MLM will also
            allow us to test whether there are any significant variations in treatment effect
            between facilitators. The impact of missing data will also be evaluated.
         </p>
         <p>The sample size needed was based upon psychometrics of our primary outcome measure,
            the RDAS. Assuming a two-sided test, a standard deviation for mean change in RDAS
            from T1 to T2 equal to 3.4 (standard deviation of RDAS = 7.0, with a correlation of
            0.9 between T1 and T2), an intracluster correlation of 0.3, an effect size of 0.5
            for mean change of RDAS (difference in group means = 1.8), 80% power, and an alpha
            of 0.05, 36 couples will be required for each group (PASS, NCSS, Kaysville, USA, cluster-randomization
            power analysis) 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">110</span>
            </span>. The total sample size was calculated as 36 × 2 × 2 = 144. The sample size will be
            increased to 160 (40 couples per group) due to an expected attrition of 10% of the
            participants across time, based on previous research in couples and BC

               <span tagx="abbr">111</span>

            evaluation of each DLM following its completion.

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The potential for Couplelinks to fill a void in the support options available to both
         younger women with BC and their male partners is great. The intervention, if proven
         effective, will be the first empirically validated online support tool for heterosexual
         couples with the female partner belonging to the highly distressed and inadequately
         served population of young BC survivors. Moreover, this validated program will address
         the consistently demonstrated need for targeted resources that appeal to their male
         partners. If effective, this standardized psychosocial intervention can be readily
         incorporated into existing psychosocial oncology programs, with the added benefit
         of independence from geographic disparities. Moreover, as one of the first couple
         interventions of its kind, Couplelinks will help set a clinical and scholarly precedent
         for the delivery of online support to couples in distress. The ultimate impact of
         the study will be the creation of an accessible, empirically validated tool that could
         help to improve the quality of life of future young couples coping with BC, regardless
         of geographic location.
      </p>
      <p>Assuming effectiveness is demonstrated, the next step would be to refine the treatment
         and training manual, and disseminate the program to psychosocial oncology professionals.
         They, in turn, would have access to the website on a cost-recovery basis in order
         to offer the program within their own communities and provinces. Furthermore, as an
         empirically validated prototype, Couplelinks may be adapted for other subgroups of
         BC survivors and their partners, such as same-sex or middle-aged couples, or for couples
         dealing with other types of cancer.
