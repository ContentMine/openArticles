      "One of the challenges in treating patients with heart failure (HF) is achieving clinical stability and reducing the hospital readmission rate. A diuretic dose adjustment algorithm developed in the United States (Diuretic Treatment Algorithm, DTA) and later validated for use in Brazil (as the Algoritmo de Ajuste de Diurético, AAD) has proved feasible and readily applicable, but its effect on clinical outcomes has yet to be assessed. This report aims to describe a randomized clinical trial protocol designed to assess the effectiveness of the AAD and of nonpharmacologic management in improving clinical stability and reducing the readmission rate at 90 days in patients with HF."
