               </div>
               <p>Despite the well-known importance of cognitive deficits for everyday functioning in
                  patients with severe mental illness (SMI), evidence-based interventions directed at
                  these problems are especially scarce for SMI patients in long-term clinical facilities.
                  Cognitive adaptation Training (CAT) is a compensatory approach that aims at creating
                  new routines in patients’ living environments through the use of environmental supports.
                  Previous studies on CAT showed that CAT is effective in improving everyday functioning
                  in outpatients with schizophrenia. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect
                  of CAT as a nursing intervention in SMI patients who reside in long-term clinical
                  facilities.

               <p>This is a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial comparing CAT (intervention
                  group) as a nursing intervention to treatment as usual (control group). The primary
                  goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of CAT on everyday functioning. Secondary outcomes
                  are quality of life, empowerment and apathy. Further, an economic evaluation will
                  be performed. The study has a duration of one year, with four follow-up assessments
                  at 15, 18, 21 and 24 months for the intervention group.

               <p>There is a need for evidence-based interventions that contribute to the improvement
                  of the functional recovery of long-term residential patients. If our hypotheses are

                  to implement the method in standardized care.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The term severe mental illness (SMI) defines a range of psychiatric disorders, characterized
         by serious mental, social and vocational problems that influence each other and create
         a need for long-term continuous care by mental health professionals 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. The majority of the SMI population suffers from schizophrenia or related psychotic
         disorders, which are characterized by positive symptoms (such as hallucinations and/or
         delusions), negative symptoms (such as amotivation, social withdrawal and/or blunted
         affect) and cognitive deficits (such as planning, memory and/or attention issues).
         Furthermore, people with autism, obsessive compulsive disorder, personality disorder,
         bipolar disorder or major depression are also considered to be suffering from SMI
         when they follow a severe course of the illness 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. In the Netherlands, patients with SMI are admitted to long-stay facilities when
         they are unable to live independently and need more support than can be provided at
         assisted or sheltered living facilities. Based on the most recent estimations, approximately
         10% of the adult SMI population is living in long-stay clinical facilities in the
         Netherlands 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. The degree of care dependency strongly relates to everyday functioning 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>, and is predicted by cognitive impairments, common in the majority of SMI patients
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>. Despite the strong relationship between cognition and everyday functioning, evidence-based
         interventions are scarce, especially for those who reside in long-stay clinical facilities.
         Two main approaches can be distinguished with regard to interventions for cognitive
         problems in SMI: restorative and compensatory.
      </p>
      <p>Restorative approaches, such as cognitive remediation, aim to improve functional outcomes
         through enhanced cognitive functioning. In cognitive remediation, people are typically
         trained using computer training software. Cognitive remediation techniques have been
         extensively studied and though they attain small positive effects on cognition, recent
         (meta-analytic) studies demonstrated that these improvements do not generalize to
         functional improvements 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>. Significant and larger effect sizes are achieved when cognitive remediation is combined
         with some form of rehabilitation program, which questions the specific therapeutic
         effects of cognitive remediation programs on global and real-world functioning 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Compensatory approaches do not aim to improve cognitive functions per se. Instead,
         they aim to bypass the cognitive deficits that hinder patients in performing their
         activities of daily living. Cognitive adaptation training (CAT) is such an approach
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>. CAT is an in-home intervention that targets real-world problems in a real-world
         setting, namely the patient’s own living environment. With the use of environmental
         supports, the patient is taught new routines that appeal less to cognitive functions.
         Furthermore, CAT interventions are strongly individualized, taking into account the
         specific problems in activities of daily living of the individual patient. Effects
         of CAT include improvements in everyday functioning, quality of life, medication adherence
         and relapse in outpatients with schizophrenia 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>CAT starts with composing an individually tailored treatment plan, based on the patient’s
         specific problems with respect to behavior, cognitive or executive functioning and
         everyday functioning. If the patient’s behavior type is predominantly characterized
         by apathy (amotivation, lack of initiative and/or lack of goal-directed behavior),
         compensation strategies will focus on cueing and prompting behavior. Patients whose
         behavior is predominantly characterized by disinhibition (easily distracted by irrelevant
         stimuli and/or behaving inappropriate in a situation) may benefit from removal of
         distracting stimuli. For patients with a mixed behavior type, both intervention strategies
         can be used. The form of the intervention is based on the level of executive functioning
         of the patient (such as planning, goal-directed behavior and mental flexibility).
         Interventions for patients with poor executive functioning are more easily noticeable
         (for example, larger signs), more specific (for example, stepwise instructions) and
         more numerous, compared to interventions for patients with fair executive functioning,
         which can be more subtle (for example, smaller signs) and less specific (for example,
         global instructions).
      </p>
      <p>Information about the patient’s cognitive strengths and weaknesses in attention and
         memory is used to further individualize the interventions. For example, if a patient
         has strong visual attention but their auditory attention is weak, they would probably
         benefit more from visual cues and/or signs than from verbal reminders. The specific
         individual problems in everyday functioning determine the individual goals at which
         the interventions are directed. Commonly used environmental supports are watches,
         calendars, electronic devices, signs, household supplies (such as boxes and cleaning
         supplies) and means of transportation (for example, the bus or a taxi pass). A CAT
         manual includes examples of specific environmental supports for 16 domains of daily
         living 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>, and was slightly adapted (by authors APMS and PQ) for practical use by psychiatric
         nurses.
      </p>
      <p>Despite the well-established effectiveness of CAT for outpatients, it remains unclear
         whether long-term residential patients can benefit from CAT in a similar way. In this
         population, the cognitive and functional deficits can be considered to be most severe.
         Therefore, CAT may bridge the gap between the current knowledge about these deficits
         and the lack of evidence-based interventions for this patient group. At the same time,
         long-stay facilities may be better able to deal with the need for ongoing support,
         which is necessary to maintain the functional improvements made with CAT 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>In the usual care of long-stay facilities, ongoing support is often provided by psychiatric
         nurses. Supporting patients in performing everyday tasks is part of their daily working
         routine. While in previous studies CAT was delivered by psychologists with a minimum
         of a bachelor’s level education, the current study aims to train psychiatric nurses
         for CAT. Involving nurses should integrate CAT in the daily working routine and thereby
         provide the continuous support which is necessary to sustain improvements that are
         made with CAT. A pilot study conducted by our group provided tentative evidence that
         CAT as a nursing intervention can improve everyday functioning in long-term residential
         patients in the Netherlands 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span>. Furthermore, a recent Canadian study demonstrated that case manager support can
         sustain CAT interventions after a period of CAT-specialized intervention 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>The abovementioned studies only included patients with a diagnosis in the schizophrenia
         spectrum, which leaves the effect of CAT on SMI patients with a different diagnosis
         unknown. However, cognitive impairments are also present in patients with other psychiatric
         disorders 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span>. Therefore we expect that SMI patients with cognitive deficits, but without the psychotic
         symptoms that characterize schizophrenia, may similarly benefit from CAT.
      </p>
      <p>The primary goal of the current study is to assess the effect of CAT as a nursing
         intervention on everyday functioning in long-term residential patients with SMI. The
         secondary goals are to evaluate the effect of CAT on quality of life, empowerment
         and apathy. Follow-up measurements will be conducted to evaluate whether obtained
         effects on primary and secondary outcome measures can be retained, as well as to evaluate
         the feasibility of integrating CAT support into the daily working routine of the nurses.
         We expect CAT as a nursing intervention to lead to improvements in everyday functioning
         and apathy, and thereby an improved quality of life for patients with SMI. As CAT
         is not designed to alter cognitive functioning (rather to bypass cognitive problems)
         or to improve positive symptoms, we do not expect these to change. Finally, we will
         assess the long-term cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the intervention. Importantly,
         in a time where available funding for mental healthcare is diminishing, evaluation
         of the costs and benefits of CAT is necessary. With this information available, mental
         health institutions will be able to make well-considered decisions with regard to
         the type of treatments and interventions that they offer.

         <p>This is a two-arm, multicenter, cluster randomized controlled trial assessing CAT
            as a nursing intervention in long-term residential patients with SMI. Patients in
            the intervention group will receive CAT in addition to treatment as usual ((TAU) CAT + TAU)
            and will be compared to the control group who will only receive TAU. Assessments take

            one year. For the intervention group, four additional assessments take place at 15,
            18, 21 and 24 months in order to investigate the long-term effects.

            <h3>Recruitment and inclusion of patients</h3>
         </div>
         <p>A total of 100 long-term residential patients suffering from SMI will be included
            in the study. Patients who participated in the pilot study or patients who are under
            18 years of age are excluded from participation. There are no other criteria held.
         </p>
         <p>Patients are recruited from the long-stay departments of three institutions in the
            Netherlands: Lentis Psychiatric Institute (Zuidlaren), Dijk en Duin Psychiatric Institute
            (Castricum) and GGZ Drenthe (Assen). The departments typically provide long-term pharmacological
            and psychosocial treatment and focus on rehabilitation and recovery for adult SMI
            patients. Admitted patients have often insufficiently recovered during several previous
            hospitalizations and/or periods of sheltered living, and experienced educational,
            vocational and social problems early in life. The majority of the patients suffer
            from psychotic disorders. Other diagnoses include severe major depression, personality
            disorders, bipolar disorder and autism.
         </p>
         <p>Patients are informed about the study by nurses from the concerning department. Patients
            are informed that participation is voluntary and that they are free to withdraw at
            any time without providing a reason and without consequence for the usual treatment.
            Questions can be directed at the nurses or the researchers (contact information is
            provided in a patient folder). Participants are required to provide written informed
            consent at baseline.

            <h3>Sample size calculation</h3>
         </div>
         <p>This sample size is based on a power analysis using the effect size (0.79) calculated
            from Multnomah Community Ability Scale (MCAS) scores from our pilot study 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
            </span>. To detect a significant change in daily functioning measured by the MCAS with α
            set at 0.05 and a power of 0.9, 35 patients should complete the intervention. Studies
            have shown that withdrawal from psychosocial interventions in psychiatric patients
            can be substantial. Therefore we have taken into account a conservative drop-out rate
            of 30% and will include at least 50 patients in each condition. Analyses are performed
            when both groups completed the assessments at 12 months and at the study end when
            follow-up assessments of the intervention group have been completed (24 months).

            <h3>Randomization</h3>
         </div>
         <p>With regard to the randomization procedure, several issues were to be considered.
            Each location employed several nursing teams, with separate offices, patient units
            and caseloads. Cluster randomization was applied on a nursing team level for each
            of the three institutions. This resulted in an equal distribution in the number of
            nursing teams allocated to CAT and TAU within each institution. Not only does this
            approach prevent contamination between nurses in the intervention and control groups,
            it also enhances implementation of the intervention since all nurses within each intervention
            team are trained in CAT and regular nursing meetings can be used for informing colleagues
            about the progression of the intervention. The nursing teams are randomly allocated
            to either the intervention or the control group by an independent staff member (without
            interest in or knowledge about the outcome of the allocation) who blindly draws a
            ticket from a basket containing a CAT ticket and a blank ticket. No inclusion or exclusion
            criteria are applied for nurses.

            <h3>Cognitive adaption training nurses and specialists</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Nurses in the intervention teams are responsible for setting up and evaluating the
            intervention for a maximum of one to three patients, while all nurses are responsible
            for supporting the daily use of interventions of all patients. Hereafter, the term
            CAT case manager refers to the former role, while the term nurse refers to the general
            tasks of all nurses in the team. CAT specialists are professionals educated to at
            least bachelor level, who have knowledge about the relationship between cognition
            and general functioning, and who are knowledgeable with regard to the underlying principles
            of CAT. Besides supervising CAT case managers in the development and implementation
            of the intervention for each individual patient, CAT specialists guard the underlying
            principles of CAT in the interventions that are applied. CAT specialists APMS and
            JER, both psychologists at Lentis Psychiatric Institute, were trained by Dr Velligan,
            the developer of CAT. They provided additional training for CAT specialists at the
            other institutions.

            <h3>Blinding</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Blinding will take place at the level of assessors of outcome variables. Blinding
            of patients and nurses is not possible due to the nature of the intervention. Similarly,
            blinding of the researcher is not possible due to the researcher’s (APMS) role in
            the training of nurses and CAT meetings with nurses. Research assistants (psychology
            students educated to at least bachelors level) are trained to administer the assessments.
            They are blind to the treatment arm in which the patient is included and do not receive
            any information with regard to the content and aims of the intervention. Nurses and
            patients are requested not to disclose any information about the allocation of conditions
            or the content of the intervention to the students. Students are instructed to inform
            the researcher immediately when they suspect blinds are broken, in which case the
            measurement is finished by another student who is still blind to the allocation of
            the patient. Furthermore, guessing of the allocation group by raters after each assessment
            will be used to evaluate whether blinding was successful.

            </div>
            <p>All participants (intervention and control group) are measured at baseline and after
               three, six, nine and 12 months. Additionally, to determine whether any obtained results
               in the intervention group can be retained, follow-up assessments are planned after
               15, 18, 21 and 24 months. Although CAT is not designed to alter cognitive functioning
               (rather to bypass cognitive problems) nor to improve symptoms, cognitive functioning
               and symptomatology are measured again at six and 12 months to evaluate any unexpected
               changes. The schedule of enrollment, interventions and content of the assessments
               is shown in Table 
               <span tagx="tblr">1</span>. For all patients, interviews and cognitive tests are assessed in separate sessions.
               In the intervention group, environmental and functional problems in everyday functioning
               are assessed in an additional session. Level of everyday functioning is chosen as
               the primary outcome. All tests and measures are described below. Secondary outcome
               measures are quality of life, empowerment and apathy. Assessment outcomes for the
               control group will not be used in their treatment plan for the duration of the trial.

               CAT specialist together with the CAT case manager. If necessary, the CAT case manager
               supports the patient in answering the questions during the interview.

               <h4>Everyday functioning</h4>
            </div>
            <p>Level of everyday functioning is measured with a number of instruments. First, the
               Multnomah Community Ability Scale (MCAS) 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">22</span>
               </span> is used to enable us to compare results with previous CAT studies. The MCAS is a
               semi-structured interview containing 17 items and assesses a variety of domains of
               community adjustment. As reports of mental healthcare professionals who are in frequent
               contact with patients tend to be more linked to performance on everyday tasks than
               self-reports 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">23</span>
               </span>, a comparison of patients’ reports and nurses’ observations (measured with observational
               questionnaires described below) is used to determine possible discrepancies between
               answers and to adapt MCAS scores if necessary. The instrument was translated into
               Dutch (PQ) and back-translated by a professional translator. The English version has
               proven to be reliable and valid 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">24</span>
               </span>.
            </p>
            <p>The second instrument used to measure everyday functioning is the Social and Occupational
               Functioning Scale (SOFAS) 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">25</span>
               </span>. The SOFAS is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring social, occupational
               and interpersonal functioning on a single-item scale (range: 0 to 100) 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">

               </span>.
            </p>
            <p>Third, engagement in work-related activities is used as an indication of everyday
               functioning. Engagement in work-related activities is measured in number of partial
               days a week (a partial day consists of three hours) and is registered daily by the
               staff.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, two observational questionnaires are filled out by a nurse (the CAT case
               manager in the intervention group; for the intervention group individual nurses are
               allocated between one and three patients for whom to complete the observational questionnaires).
               The Social Functioning Scale-other (SFS) 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">27</span>
               </span> measures functioning in society. It contains seven subscales: (1) social engagement,
               (2) interpersonal behavior, (3) pro-social activities, (4) recreation, (5) independence-competence,
               (6) independence-performance and (7) employment and/or occupation. The SFS has good
               psychometric properties 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">27</span>

                  <span tagx="abbr">28</span>
               </span>. The LSP is a questionnaire consisting of 39 questions on a four-point scale (lower
               scores indicate better life skills) and measures a range of aspects related to successful
               community or hospital living: (1) self-care, (2) non-turbulence, (3) social contact,
               (4) communication and (5) responsibility. The scale has shown good psychometric properties
               when completed by case workers and residential staff

            <p>To optimize the implementation of CAT and to ensure CAT would be included in the working
               routine, all nurses in the intervention groups were trained in CAT, though not screened
               for eligibility. Nurses participate in a didactical group training prior to the recruitment
               of patients. The training is delivered by the CAT specialists who were trained in
               CAT by Dr Velligan, the developer of CAT (APMS and JER). Translated PowerPoint presentations
               and video demonstrations of Dr Velligan serve as the basis of the didactical training,
               to ensure fidelity to the CAT treatment model. The didactical training includes the
               theoretical background and principles, assessments, use of the CAT manual, intervention
               strategies, CAT visits and continuity of the intervention. APMS and JER provided an
               additional training on assessing the EFA, composing the CAT treatment plan (see below)
               and continuity of CAT in daily care for the CAT specialists at all intervention locations.

               <h4>Designing the cognitive adaptation training treatment plan</h4>
            </div>
            <p>The protocol developed by Dr Velligan and her group (personal communication, A.P.M
               Stiekema, P.J. Quee) is followed to design the CAT treatment plan, with some minor
               modifications due to the availability of tests translated into Dutch. The CAT plan
               and starting point of the intervention is based on: (1) behavior type, (2) level of
               executive functioning, (3) goals for improving everyday functioning and (4) cognitive
               strengths and weaknesses that are assessed at T0. Upon completion of this assessment,
               a CAT specialist summarizes the outcomes of the cognitive assessment and discusses
               these with the CAT case manager during the first CAT meeting. Based on the wishes
               and problems reported by the patient during the EFA, the CAT specialist and the CAT
               case manager discuss the priority of problems and make an initial priority of goals
               that may be targeted with the intervention. In the next step of the intervention process,
               the CAT case manager discusses the assessments with the patient during the first CAT
               visit. The patient is encouraged to formulate their own goal, however if they are
               unable to do so, the CAT case manager suggests a goal according to the priority of
               the initial CAT plan. If necessary, the priority on the CAT plan is adapted following
               the wishes of the patient after the first or subsequent CAT visits.

               <h4>Implementing the cognitive adaptation training treatment plan</h4>
            </div>
            <p>Once the CAT treatment plan is formed and discussed with the patient, the CAT specialist
               and CAT case manager discuss possible interventions using the CAT manual and taking
               individual characteristics into account. Possible intervention strategies are discussed
               and set up together with the patient when in any way possible. Intervention strategies
               are limited to one goal at a time to ensure patients are not faced with more than
               they can handle. After the first intervention the CAT case manager is responsible
               for setting up and organizing environmental supports and evaluating the interventions
               with the patients in their caseload. CAT visits to the patients are planned within
               the daily routine of the nurses. Based on our pilot study, a duration of CAT visits
               of approximately 45 minutes a week per patient in total (time may be divided over
               a number of CAT visits) is deemed to be sufficient. In addition, the CAT case manager
               makes a record of the CAT visits in the patient file, based upon four questions: what
               interventions worked, what interventions did not work, what changes are made in the
               intervention strategies and what issues need to be kept in mind.
            </p>
            <p>During the implementation phase (one to two months), the CAT specialist and CAT case
               manager plan CAT discussion meetings at least once a month. The nursing team as a
               whole is informed of, and responsible for, and supports the daily use of the interventions
               of all patients (for example, checking and reporting on whether a recorded message
               leads to the targeted behavior, or changing a weekly checklist). In the securing phase
               (up to 12 months), CAT group meetings are incorporated into regular staff meetings
               for at least another six months, to stimulate the exchange of knowledge and interventions
               between nurses. Finally, after the securing phase (after 12 months), a CAT focus group
               including the researchers and clinicians (APM, JER and LM) and a delegation of nurses,
               will determine the form and frequency of CAT meetings in the follow-up phase (12 to
               48 months).

               point after baseline. The analyses are corrected for baseline scores to eliminate
               the effect of possible (average) differences between the intervention and control
               group at baseline. The treatment effect is essentially estimated for each time point
               by subtracting the estimated mean scores of the control group from the estimated mean
               scores of the intervention group, reflecting the estimated mean difference between

               is, we will evaluate whether patients have indeed improved on the activities they
               have been working on with CAT, and for which individually tailored interventions were
               set up. Sum scores of items of the LSP, and SFS reflecting a certain goal will be
               computed. Differences in these sum scores over time will reflect whether patients’
               performance on these domains have improved, did not change or have deteriorated. Generalized
               linear models will be used to determine whether there is a statistically significant
               proportion of improvement target behaviors compared to no change or deterioration.

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>In SMI care, especially in the chronic stage of the disease, there is a necessity
         for practical hands-on interventions that target the functional impairments resulting
         from cognitive deficits in such a way that functional improvements are made, and can
         also be sustained after a study period. Primarily the latter aspect made us choose
         an intervention that can be applied by those healthcare professionals who support
         patients in their daily routine, namely psychiatric nurses. The current, multicenter,
         cluster randomized controlled trial meets with these needs by assessing the efficacy
         of CAT as a nursing intervention on everyday functioning in residential patients with
         SMI. We hypothesize that CAT as a nursing intervention leads to improvements in everyday
         functioning (primary outcome) and apathy, and thereby in quality of life and empowerment
         (secondary outcomes).
      </p>
      <p>A strength of this study is that patients are recruited from multiple psychiatric
         institutions spread across the Netherlands, increasing representativeness and thus
         increasing generalizability. An additional strength is that it addresses the long-term
         effects of the intervention (up to two years). The length of the study takes into
         account that rehabilitation in long-term residential patients is a slow process 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">39</span>
         </span>. Furthermore, by following up on everyday functioning for up to two years (one year
         after completion of the study), we will evaluate whether CAT has been successfully
         incorporated in the working routine of nurses. This is important because the nurses
         will have to provide ongoing support to sustain improvements. Another strength is
         that the outcomes of everyday functioning are not solely based on self-reports, but
         are also assessed by the number of work-related activities per week, and by observational
         questionnaires that are filled out by the CAT case manager. As such, we use various
         measures to substantiate our impression of the level of everyday functioning of the
         patients. Furthermore, this approach allows us to collect data even if the patient
         misses an assessment. Finally, because of our choice not to hold common eligibility
         criteria, for example with regard to diagnosis or (prior) comorbid psychiatric or
         somatic disorders, our results will be better generalizable to the whole SMI population,
         instead of only pertaining to schizophrenia patients. This is important since it increases
         the clinical importance and external validity of our findings.
      </p>
      <p>Possible weaknesses of the study are the lack of measurements focusing on the nurses
         who carry out the intervention. Motivation, self-efficacy and empowerment of the nurses
         may mediate the effect of the intervention, but an absence of appropriate instruments
         in this regard leaves us unable to take these aspects into account. Moreover, there
         are few instruments that are specifically designed for measuring everyday functioning
         of patients residing in long-stay clinical facilities, whose problems and needs may
         differ from patients living in the community. Finding a suitable instrument is further
         complicated by the fact that areas for interventions are individually determined and
         therefore differ for each patient. Due to the global nature of the measures of everyday
         functioning, our instruments may not be sensitive enough to assess improvements because
         CAT aims to improve one or two areas of functioning at a time. For this reason, we
         included the additional sub-analyses in the statistical analysis plan that specifically
         evaluate improvements in targeted domains (as described in the statistical analysis
         section).
      </p>
      <p>If evidence yields support for CAT, this may fulfill a need for a hands-on intervention
         that can contribute to the functional recovery of patients living in long-stay clinical
         facilities.
