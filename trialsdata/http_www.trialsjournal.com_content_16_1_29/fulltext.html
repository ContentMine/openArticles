   <div class="collapsible-content">
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Smoking in pregnancy is a public health problem. Self-help smoking cessation support
         can help pregnant women to stop smoking, but the effects of delivering this kind of
         support via SMS text message are not known. A previous randomised controlled trial
         (RCT) demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of providing such support to
         pregnant smokers using an automated, tailored text message intervention called MiQuit.
         This larger RCT will estimate key parameters for and will test the feasibility of
         delivering a major trial run within the United Kingdom National Health Service settings
         aimed at providing definitive evidence on the utility of MiQuit for helping pregnant
         smokers to stop.
      </p>
      <h4>Methods/Design</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">This will be a multi-centre, parallel group RCT. Participants are being identified
         in 16 English antenatal care settings and must be &gt;16&nbsp;years old, pregnant, &lt;25&nbsp;weeks
         gestation, smoke &gt;1 daily cigarette, have smoked &gt;5 daily cigarettes before pregnancy,
         and able to understand texts in English. After consenting and  the collection of baseline
         data, participants are randomised to control or intervention groups in a 1:1 ratio;
         randomisation is stratified by trial site and gestation and employs computer-generated
         pseudo-random code using random permuted blocks of randomly varying size, and held
         on a secure server. All participants receive a National Health Service (NHS) leaflet
         aimed at helping them to stop smoking. Intervention group women also receive the 12-week
         MiQuit programme of tailored, supportive, interactive text message, self-help cessation
         support. Women are followed up by telephone 4&nbsp;weeks after randomisation and at 36&nbsp;weeks
         gestation. The study aims to recruit 400 women, and with this sample we will be able
         to estimate trial centres’ recruitment rates to within +/−1% (margin of error = half
         width of 95% confidence interval); individual trial groups’ ascertainment of rates
         for smoking outcomes between 4&nbsp;weeks after randomisation until approximately 36&nbsp;weeks
         gestation to within +/−4%, and across both groups, the combined cessation rate at
         36&nbsp;weeks +/−3%.
      </p>
      <h4>Discussion</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Pilot trial completion will provide data to facilitate planning for a definitive trial
         investigating whether MiQuit works for smoking cessation in pregnancy.

   <div class="collapsible-content">
      <p style="line-height:160%">Epidemiological evidence indicates that smoking during pregnancy increases the risk
         of many pregnancy-related complications including low birth weight, preterm birth,
         spontaneous abortions, stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy and neonatal death and is associated
         with many adverse postnatal problems including impaired lung function and Sudden Infant
         Death Syndrome <a name="d73565e220"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B1'); return false;" href="#B1">1</a>]. Taking into account that between one in four <a name="d73565e224"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B2'); return false;" href="#B2">2</a>] and one in eight <a name="d73565e228"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B3'); return false;" href="#B3">3</a>] women are estimated to smoke during pregnancy, the consequences of prenatal smoking
         come at a great financial cost to the health service.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">A review of smoking cessation interventions for pregnant smokers indicates that such
         interventions can be effective at increasing cessation during pregnancy, although
         the increase is fairly modest <a name="d73565e234"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B4'); return false;" href="#B4">4</a>]. Although smoking cessation support is offered to pregnant smokers through the NHS
         Stop Smoking Services in England, uptake rates are fairly low <a name="d73565e238"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B5'); return false;" href="#B5">5</a>],<a name="d73565e242"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B6'); return false;" href="#B6">6</a>]. While it is important to explore ways of increasing the uptake of face-to-face specialist
         support among this population, it is equally important to explore the potential of
         alternative forms of support.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">One such alternative is self-help. A recent review of the literature indicates that
         self-help interventions for pregnant smokers almost double the chances of quitting
         compared with usual care <a name="d73565e248"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B7'); return false;" href="#B7">7</a>]. Furthermore, self-help has been identified as being of high interest to pregnant
         smokers interested in quitting smoking <a name="d73565e252"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B8'); return false;" href="#B8">8</a>]. It is also generally of low cost and, potentially, has wide reach. One promising
         mode of delivery for self-help support is through mobile phone text messages. A recent
         large trial of a text message smoking cessation intervention for non-pregnant smokers
         found it doubled cessation rates compared with a no-intervention control group <a name="d73565e256"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B9'); return false;" href="#B9">9</a>]. Regarding its potential for pregnant smokers, mobile phone ownership is high across
         the social class spectrum in the UK, and text messaging is particularly popular among
         those under 45&nbsp;years of age <a name="d73565e260"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B10'); return false;" href="#B10">10</a>].
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">A pilot trial of a tailored self-help intervention developed for pregnant smokers
         in Cambridge (called MiQuit) found that delivering support by text message to pregnant
         smokers was feasible and also acceptable for recipients <a name="d73565e266"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B11'); return false;" href="#B11">11</a>]. Furthermore, the MiQuit intervention increased the likelihood of women setting a
         quit date and increased women’s harm beliefs (related to smoking) and confidence in
         their ability and determination to quit. Although this trial was small (n = 207),
         it provided an estimate for MiQuit’s efficacy, albeit with wide 95% confidence intervals,
         which suggests that this intervention could be a valuable addition to standard NHS
         support for smoking cessation in pregnancy. At 12&nbsp;weeks after randomisation, 12.5%
         of women who used MiQuit reported not having smoked in the previous 7&nbsp;days, which
         was validated using salivary cotinine assessment, compared with only 7.8% in the control
         group; if MiQuit could have such an impact in routine NHS care, its low cost would
         make it highly cost-effective.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Before MiQuit could be used in routine care, a definitive randomised controlled trial
         would need to prove its effectiveness, so obtaining further evidence concerning its
         efficacy is appropriate. However, such a trial would need to be very large and expensive
         and, currently, there is insufficient information to justify conducting this. For
         example, it is not known if cessation encouraged by MiQuit, in the pilot trial, which
         was measured, at 12&nbsp;weeks after randomisation (around mid-pregnancy), persists beyond
         this point. However, sustained cessation throughout pregnancy would be required before
         one could expect this potentially-useful intervention to have a meaningful impact
         on fetal health. Also, there is only very limited information with which one could
         plan a definitive trial such that this made efficient use of research resources; for
         example, likely recruitment and follow-up rates need determining. Consequently, we
         propose a pilot trial, which will investigate whether or not it is possible to evaluate
         MiQuit in a multi-centre RCT located within the NHS research infrastructure, taking
         full advantage of appropriate NHS research network resources. This study will provide
         estimates for the following parameters, which will be of crucial importance when deciding
         upon resources required for a definitive trial: the range of likely recruitment rates
         in different centres; quit rates amongst trial participants; feasibility of assessing
         smoking status of trial participants in later pregnancy; ascertainment rates obtained;
         and the likely effect of MiQuit when women are offered this in NHS settings. Findings
         from the pilot trial will permit estimation of the likely impact of MiQuit being introduced
         into routine clinical practice.
      </p>
      <h4>Aims and objectives</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The aim of this trial is to estimate the likely impact of the MiQuit text message-based
         smoking cessation intervention for pregnant smokers and to establish robust estimates
         for key parameters, which would be required in order to design a definitive trial
         of this intervention.
      </p>
      <h4>Primary objective</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The primary objective of this study is to estimate the key parameters required in
         order to design a definitive trial testing the efficacy of MiQuit, including the following:
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">1. Recruitment rates within pregnant smokers attending hospital recruitment centres</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">2. For individual trial groups, rates of ascertainment of validated smoking cessation
         between 4&nbsp;weeks after randomisation until late pregnancy (approximately 36&nbsp;weeks)
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">3. For both trial groups, the combined quit rate at 36&nbsp;weeks (cessation as defined
         above).
      </p>
      <h4>Secondary objectives</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The secondary objectives are as follows:</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">1. To estimate and model the likely effectiveness and cost effectiveness of MiQuit
         compared with usual care including a generic smoking cessation information leaflet.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">2. To document participants’ use of MiQuit interactive features and of NHS cessation
         support.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">3. To assess the effect of MiQuit on social cognitive determinants of quitting smoking.</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">4. To explore participant views and experiences of using MiQuit.</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">5. To explore research staff views and experiences of the MiQuit pilot trial.</p>

   <div class="collapsible-content">
      <h4>Trial design</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">This study is a multicentre, two-arm, parallel group, single blind, randomised controlled
         trial testing the MiQuit text message smoking cessation support system in pregnant
         women.
      </p>
      <h4>Study setting</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Participants will be recruited from hospital antenatal clinics in England.</p>
      <h4>Eligibility criteria</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">To be eligible for the trial participants must be i) pregnant and less than 25&nbsp;weeks
         gestation, ii) have smoked at least 5 cigarettes per day pre-pregnancy and have continued
         to smoke at least 1 cigarette on a typical day during pregnancy, iii) aged 16 or over,
         iv) agree to accept information to assist cessation, v) have their own or have primary
         use of a mobile phone, vi) be familiar with sending and receiving text messages, vii)
         be able to understand written English (text messages are in English only) and consent
         issues explained in English, and viii) be able to give informed consent.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">They should not already be enrolled in another text service to assist smoking cessation.</p>
      <h4>Intervention</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">MiQuit is an automated responsive text message support programme lasting 12&nbsp;weeks,
         which provides tailored smoking cessation support and advice to the participant’s
         mobile phone. The MiQuit system provides advice and support content that is tailored
         to 12 characteristics of the individual at baseline and is tailored to changes in
         smoking status collected at two time points during the 12-week programme. In addition,
         participants can text in a quit date and receive additional support tailored around
         this date. Participants can also increase or decrease the frequency of support they
         receive at any time by texting the keywords MORE or LESS. The support includes motivational
         messages, advice about preparing for a quit attempt, how to manage cravings and withdrawal,
         dealing with trigger situations, information about how smoking affects babies and
         general encouragement. Participants will receive between 70 and 145 texts over 12&nbsp;weeks
         (0.8 to 1.7 texts per day), dependent upon how they use the system. They also will
         have the ability to request instant support text messages on demand or distraction
         messages by texting one of three keywords to the MiQuit system. Any text message replies
         to MiQuit made by participants will be charged at the usual network rate or included
         in their text allowance, but texts they received from MiQuit are free. All likely
         costs to participants will be made clear in the participant information sheet (PIS).
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">In addition to the MiQuit text message intervention, intervention group participants
         will receive a standard NHS leaflet giving some information and advice on stopping
         smoking and usual NHS antenatal care.
      </p>
      <h4>Control</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Control group participants will receive the same NHS leaflet giving some information
         and advice on stopping smoking in addition to usual NHS antenatal care.
      </p>
      <h4>Adherence</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Participants allocated to receive the MiQuit intervention will have an adherence check
         performed at the late pregnancy/postnatal follow-up stage, at 36&nbsp;weeks gestation (visit
         3). At this stage participants will be asked basic questions about their use of the
         texts sent.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">If they wish, participants in both groups will be able to access additional support
         to help them stop smoking; they will all be asked about any use of support at each
         contact.
      </p>
      <h4>Outcomes</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">There is no single primary outcome for this pilot trial, which deals primarily with
         feasibility issues.
      </p>
      <h4>Feasibility outcomes</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Feasibility outcomes include the following:</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">1. Recruitment rate of participants from pregnant smokers attending trial centres.</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">2. For individual trial groups, proportions of participants with validated smoking
         cessation data collected between 4&nbsp;weeks after randomisation until late pregnancy
         (at approximately 36&nbsp;weeks gestation).
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">3. For both trial groups combined, collection of validated smoking cessation data,
         as above, measured in late pregnancy (approximately 36&nbsp;weeks gestation).
      </p>
      <h4>Smoking outcomes</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Smoking outcomes are described below:</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">1. Proportion of participants with self-reported, continuous abstinence from smoking
         from 4&nbsp;weeks after randomisation until follow-up in late pregnancy (approximately
         36&nbsp;weeks gestation), <em>validated</em> by exhaled CO and/or saliva cotinine estimation; there will be no ‘grace period’
         <a name="d73565e381"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B12'); return false;" href="#B12">12</a>]. Participants who report smoking no more than five cigarettes in total between the
         start of their quit attempt (within 4&nbsp;weeks of randomisation) and late pregnancy will
         be considered to have quit smoking <a name="d73565e385"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B13'); return false;" href="#B13">13</a>].
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">(Note: Participants who cannot be contacted at 4&nbsp;weeks after randomisation, but who,
         in late pregnancy, report cessation as outlined above, will be counted as positive
         for the late pregnancy cessation outcome).
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">NB: We anticipate the above outcome being a <em>primary outcome</em> for any definitive trial that follows this study.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">2. Proportion of participants with self-reported abstinence from smoking from 4&nbsp;weeks
         after randomisation until late pregnancy (at approximately 36&nbsp;weeks gestation).
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">3. Proportion of participants with self-reported and validated 7&nbsp;day point prevalence
         cessation measured in late pregnancy (approximately 36&nbsp;weeks gestation).
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">4. Proportion of participants with self-reported 7-day point-prevalence cessation
         at 4&nbsp;weeks after randomisation.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">5. Number of 24&nbsp;hour quit attempts reported in late pregnancy (approximately 36&nbsp;weeks
         gestation).
      </p>
      <h4>Other outcomes</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Other outcomes include the following:</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">1. Use of NHS cessation support.</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">2. Social cognitive variables such as health beliefs and outcome expectancies.</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">3. Process variables such as number of contacts with MiQuit for tailoring of content
         and increase or decrease requests.
      </p>
      <h4>Assignment of interventions: allocation and blinding</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">After entering all baseline data onto a secure online database, research midwives
         or central staff will randomise participants via this database; however, these staff
         will be unaware of the participant’s allocated group. Randomisation will use a computer-generated
         pseudo-random code with random permuted blocks of randomly varying size, created by
         the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit and held on a secure server. The randomisation
         will be stratified by site and gestation (&lt;16&nbsp;weeks versus ≥16&nbsp;weeks). The database
         will then send an email to inform unblinded central administrators who are not involved
         in participant follow-up of the allocation; they will then send participants an information
         pack, which will provide further information on participant allocation. Local hospital
         staff and central staff involved in follow-up will remain blind to treatment allocation
         as far as possible; however, as participants are not blinded it is possible that they
         may unintentionally reveal their allocation during follow-up. In addition, staff carrying
         out the final follow-up calls will need to ask participants questions about the intervention
         and so will become unblinded towards the end of this call. There should be no other
         reasons why unblinding is needed. Researchers carrying out the analyses will remain
         blind. Further details are provided in the data collection sections.
      </p>
      <h4>Recruitment</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Women will be recruited as they attend hospitals for antenatal screening (ultrasound)
         appointments using one or both of two different methods, depending on the locally-available
         resources in participating Acute Trusts. For both recruitment methods, all pregnant
         women attending clinics will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire, which identifies
         smokers and asks those who would like to receive self-help cessation support in the
         context of a research study to provide contact details. A PIS will be attached to
         the questionnaire. Questionnaires will be distributed by a member of the patient’s
         usual care team (for example, receptionist or midwife); information about the trial
         will be displayed in relevant clinical areas and adverts in clinic environments may
         also be used to aid recruitment. The two methods of recruitment are described as follows:
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">1. 
         <em>Via trial co-ordinating centre staff</em>: A trust staff member will oversee daily collation of questionnaires and interested
         women’s contact details at each recruiting site, sending these to a trial office by
         fax or post. A member of the study team, who has been appropriately trained, would
         then telephone potentially-interested women and ensure that all aspects pertaining
         to study participation are verbally-addressed prior to obtaining consent.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">2. 
         <em>Via staff in Acute Trust</em>: This method of recruitment will only be used in trial centres in which Comprehensive
         Local Research Network (CLRN) research midwives are available. Consent will, in the
         main, be obtained in person by a CLRN research midwife (RM); however, should the patient
         need to leave before consent can be obtained, a member of the team may call and consent
         over the telephone as for method one. A trust staff member or the RM working within
         these recruiting sites will oversee collation of questionnaires and the RM will follow
         up face-to-face those respondents who are interested in participating, usually while
         they are still in clinic. The RM will offer trial enrolment to all eligible, interested
         women ensuring that relevant aspects of trial procedures are fully explained prior
         to obtaining written informed consent. Those women who are not able to wait will be
         asked (where possible) for a convenient time to contact by telephone where the process
         will be fully explained and consent provided verbally.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">This trial will, therefore, investigate the feasibility of the two recruitment methods
         and will also provide an estimate of CLRN resources that might be required for a definitive
         study using the second recruitment method. A variety of NHS Trusts will be used as
         recruitment sites to encourage diversity of recruitment and increase generalisability.
         Reasons why potential participants are not recruited will be collected and reported.
      </p>
      <h4>Withdrawal of participants from intervention or assessments</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Participants may be withdrawn from the trial either at their own request or at the
         discretion of the Investigator. Participants who experience miscarriage or fetal death
         will be advised to withdraw from the trial.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Individuals in the MiQuit arm may cancel text messages by sending a ‘STOP’ text message
         at any time during the programme’s duration. However, unless they specifically withdraw,
         they will remain in the trial as participants.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Any participant who has already participated in the study may not re-enter at a later
         date.
      </p>
      <h4>Participant timeline and data collection</h4>
      <h4>Pre-Screen</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">All potential participants will be identified via a brief questionnaire, which will
         be attached to a participant information sheet.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%"><em>Recruitment method one</em>: For recruitment by this method a member of the Co-ordinating centre study team will
         complete and sign the consent form noting that the consent was taken by telephone.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%"><em>Recruitment method two</em>: This will cover the details as for method one, except that the participant can provide
         either written or verbal informed consent; an RM working within the participating
         acute trust will explain all aspects of the study and will counter-sign the consent
         form in both cases.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">All participants will be asked to give written informed consent for the collection
         of an exhaled breath and/or saliva sample if they report a quit at the week 36 follow-up.
         They will be made aware that the provision of samples will only be required if a quit
         is reported at week 36 of their pregnancy and that this may involve a visit to the
         participant’s home by the research midwife. If the participant is not happy to be
         visited at home but is happy to provide a saliva sample, postal sample kits are available.
         Carbon monoxide levels in exhaled breath samples can only be measured in person during
         a home visit.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Participants will also be given the option at the beginning of the study to consent
         to be contacted by the study team to discuss whether they would be interested in being
         interviewed as part of an intervention process evaluation. They will not be consenting
         to the interview at the start of the study.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">All participants will be provided with clear information about how to withdraw their
         consent via Freepost postcard (provided to all participants), text, email, or telephone.
         In a similar trial in which we provided similar methods to facilitate informed consent,
         fewer than 60 participants (from &gt;2,500) withdrew consent after enrolment <a name="d73565e475"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B14'); return false;" href="#B14">14</a>].

      <h4>Visit 1 - baseline</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">After giving informed consent, participants will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire,
         which may be over the telephone with the study team member (<em>recruitment method one</em>) or over the telephone with a local RM or in person by the RM (<em>recruitment method two</em>). This will confirm contact details and ask about socio- demographic data, smoking
         attitudes and behaviour (for MiQuit tailoring), heaviness of smoking <a name="d73565e849"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B15'); return false;" href="#B15">15</a>], gestational age, number of births beyond 24&nbsp;weeks, partner’s (significant other’s)
         smoking status and health status (EQ-5D) <a name="d73565e853"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B16'); return false;" href="#B16">16</a>].
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The researcher will enter the participant details on the electronic database and then
         randomise the participant. This will ensure the researcher will remain blinded to
         the participant allocation. The participants are randomised, using the Nottingham
         Clinical Trials Unit's web-based service, to intervention (MiQuit) or control. For
         participants in either trial arm, a specific information sheet, which describes only
         details of procedures employed within that arm, will be generated and sent to them
         by a non-blinded member of the trial team who is not involved in follow-up. Documentation
         will also include a leaflet giving some information and advice on stopping smoking,
         details of a contact point for participants who have questions about trial involvement
         and details of how participants can reverse their decision to take part (outlined
         in - removal of participants from intervention or assessments). The PIS, information
         sheets and consent form will be available in English only, as understanding of English
         is required to receive the MiQuit intervention.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Follow-up contacts will use a blend of postal, telephone, email/web and SMS text messaging
         reminders to elicit maximal response rates. For those participants reporting a quit,
         where possible, a home visit from their local RM will be arranged.
      </p>
      <h4>Visit 2 - 4-week follow-up</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%"><em>At 4&nbsp;weeks after randomisation</em>, participants will be contacted via telephone in order to assess smoking status,
         numbers of quit attempts lasting more than 24&nbsp;hours, quality of life information (EQ-5D)
         and use of NHS and non-NHS smoking cessation support in the period since randomisation.
         This visit will, in general, be performed via telephone by a member of the study team
         at the co-ordinating centre, blind to treatment allocation; however, should the study
         team be unable to contact by the participant by telephone, other methods will be used
         in an attempt to elicit the best response. These include; posting a short questionnaire
         with explanatory letter and pre-paid return envelope, or sending a link, which allows
         web-based completion or by text.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">It is possible that if members of the co-ordinating centre study team speak to participants
         at the 4-week follow-up, they may become un-blinded for the late pregnancy follow-up
         (visit 3). However, the value of exploring the feasibility of different follow-up
         approaches for this pilot trial outweighs the small risk of bias presented by this
         scenario.
      </p>
      <h4>Visit 3 - late pregnancy/postnatal follow-up</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%"><em>At 36&nbsp;weeks gestation</em>: Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire (data to be collected up
         to 10&nbsp;weeks after estimated delivery date will be acceptable for use). This will include
         quality of life information (EQ-5D) and measures of smoking behaviour, attitudinal/behavioural
         information, use of NHS smoking cessation support and participants’ ratings of the
         intervention (MiQuit arm only). As for the 4-week visit, this visit will be performed
         mainly via telephone by a member of the study team at the co-ordinating centre, blind
         to treatment allocation. As for the 4-week visit, previously-described alternative
         methods will be employed to elicit the best response rate.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">It is recognised that asking about the intervention at follow-up will result in the
         researcher who conducts the late pregnancy follow-up becoming un-blinded. To ensure
         that this has minimal impact on follow-up data obtained, the participants will be
         asked items about the intervention at the end of the interview/questionnaire starting
         with the question ‘<em>Did you receive any stop smoking text messages from the study team</em>?’
      </p>
      <h4>Visit 4 - validation of smoking status</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">During this assessment, whether in person or by post, participants will be asked to
         report their smoking status and recent use of nicotine replacement therapies.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Participants self-reporting abstinence in late pregnancy will have their smoking status
         validated by exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) readings and/or salivary cotinine samples.
         The validation of smoking cessation would be initiated as soon as possible after notification
         of abstinence at visit 3.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Exhaled CO will be measured using a validated hand held CO monitor and can only be
         taken when a researcher is able to visit the participant in their home. Saliva samples
         for cotinine (a metabolite of nicotine) analysis could be collected at the same visit.
         Ideally both forms of assessment would be used, but either CO or cotinine assessment
         would be sufficient on their own if difficulties in getting a valid sample are experienced
         with either method. Where it is not possible to visit a participant in their home,
         a salivary sample pack will be sent by post and participants will be invited to return
         a sample in a pre-paid postal packet. Written consent agreeing to provide the samples
         for validation will be obtained from any participants who did not give this consent
         at baseline (that is, those who were recruited via telephone). This consent will be
         obtained either during the home visit or by sending a consent form for the participant
         to complete and return with a postal saliva sample. Cut-off points for biochemical
         verification will be determined according to the latest evidence, but defined abstinence
         is likely to be in the region of &lt;9&nbsp;ppm for CO readings and &lt;10 ng/ml for salivary
         cotinine <a name="d73565e894"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B17'); return false;" href="#B17">17</a>].
      </p>
      <h4>Duration of the trial</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">It is anticipated that the total duration of the study will be 20&nbsp;months. This will
         include 12&nbsp;months of recruitment and 8&nbsp;months of follow-up.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Late pregnancy outcome ascertainment is intended to be at 36&nbsp;weeks gestation, or at
         latest, within two weeks of birth. However, if outcome data become available after
         this point, we will permit it to be used in analyses provided the timing of data collection
         is no later than 10&nbsp;weeks after the estimated due date.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Qualitative interviews undertaken as part of a process evaluation will be carried
         out shortly after the late pregnancy follow-up and are not planned to be carried out
         any later than 10&nbsp;weeks after the estimated delivery date.
      </p>
      <h4>End of the trial</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The end of the trial will be when the late pregnancy outcome has been ascertained
         for the final participant or it is too long after this participant’s estimated delivery
         date (EDD) for such information, if collected, to be used.
      </p>
      <h4>Participant stipends and payments</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">All participants will receive compensation for their time to the value of £5 for each
         study visit in the form of a national high street shopping voucher. Those participants
         who are asked to provide a saliva sample will be sent a £5 voucher with the sample
         request pack and a second £5 voucher on receipt of a saliva sample. Those participants
         who participate in a longer in-depth qualitative interview to gain information on
         their experience of the intervention (MiQuit arm only) will receive £20 in vouchers
         as compensation for their time.
      </p>
      <h4>Qualitative interviews for process evaluation</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">A small number of semi-structured telephone interviews will be carried out with a
         selection of participants from the MiQuit arm in order to address secondary objective
         4. This process evaluation will provide important data on participant’s experience
         of receiving support from MiQuit within the context of their everyday lives and participation
         in a trial. Semi-structured interviews will enable the researcher to have some control
         over the data collected to compliment the trial evaluation but at the same time be
         interactive and allow the participant control also. The findings will greatly assist
         the design of a definitive trial and optimisation of the intervention.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Participants will be purposively selected according to smoking status and cessation
         behaviour and use of the MiQuit system, including those who decide to discontinue
         use of MiQuit. Only participants who have already consented at baseline to be contacted
         to discuss participation in an interview will be contacted and will receive additional
         information before the call on what to expect. After completing the late pregnancy
         follow-up, participants in the MiQuit arm, who indicated at baseline that they were
         happy to be contacted about participation in an interview, will be sent a specific
         information sheet and blank consent form. A researcher will call a number of participants
         (not all) and establish if the participant is still interested in going ahead with
         the interview. If they are happy to continue, the researcher will request verbal consent
         for the interview and proceed with the interview. If the participant is interested
         but unable to continue with the interview at that time, a specific date will be set
         for the interview to take place. In every case, verbal consent will be recorded by
         the researcher before the interview goes ahead, and a copy of the consent form will
         be sent to the participant. The participant will be made aware that the interview
         will be audio-recorded and that they can withdraw from the interview at any time and
         that this would not affect their subsequent care or rights. Participants will be recruited
         until the researchers feel that data saturation has occurred (that is, the point where
         few novel insights are generated from the most recent interviews). Given the focused
         nature of the interviews, it is anticipated that this would be reached after interviewing
         10 to 15 participants. The interview schedule will include questions on the participants’
         general experience of smoking and quitting during pregnancy, their experience of using
         and interacting with MiQuit, their feelings towards whether and how MiQuit might have
         helped them engage or maintain a quit attempt, and their thoughts on how it could
         be improved.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The interviews will be undertaken by experienced personnel and last up to 60&nbsp;minutes.
         The interviews will be analysed using framework analysis, assisted by the qualitative
         analysis software NVivo. This will include looking at two main characteristics of
         the participants: that is, smoking status and use of system including those who discontinue
         (text STOP) and how these relate to several aspects of the experience of receiving
         the intervention including factors that may affect interaction with MiQuit, feelings
         towards message content and system features and suggestions for improvements for future
         use.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">A number of semi-structured telephone or face to face interviews will also be carried
         out with a selection of recruiting site research staff involved in the study in order
         to address secondary objective 5. This will provide important data on the staff experience
         of running and recruiting into the MiQuit study. As for the participant interviews,
         the semi-structured interviews will enable the team to have some control over the
         data collected to complement the trial evaluation but also be interactive to allow
         the local site research staff to have some control too. The findings will greatly
         assist the practical design of a definitive trial.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">A number of staff from recruiting centres will be selected for interview, to allow
         a variety of opinions and comments to be collected.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The objectives for these interviews are as follows:</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">1. To develop a taxonomy for describing MiQuit trial recruitment processes.</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">2. To describe research midwives’ perceptions of the key facilitators for and barriers
         against recruitment.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">3. To relate key facilitators and barriers to recruitment processes and so further
         understanding of how, in a definitive trial, recruitment could be maximised.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">4. To describe from the perspective of research midwives, those factors, which are
         perceived to influence acute trusts’ decisions to act as a trial centres (NB: after
         analysis, we will be in a position to hypothesise about how best to encourage trusts
         to sign up to being trial centres in a definitive study).
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Issues to be covered in staff interviews will include the following:</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">1. The particular process they used in their site to identify, engage and enrol participants,
         including the consent process;
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">2. their views on the local trial processes, including why particular processes were
         used, what worked well or was challenging, what the study team could have done to
         make this easier, particularly focussing on issues that it is possible to influence;
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">3. how decisions are made about Trust involvement in a particular trial and what influenced
         them to take part, whether they would consider being involved in a similar study again,
         insights into best way to achieve meaningful collaboration; and
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">4. their views on the intervention.</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The interviews will be audiotaped and analysed using thematic qualitative analysis.</p>
      <h4>Statistical methods</h4>
      <h4>Sample size and justification</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">1. 
         <em>Estimation of key trial parameters</em></p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The primary objective of this pilot trial is to demonstrate the feasibility of running
         a definitive, multi-centre trial of the MiQuit interevention within an NHS context;
         with 400 participants, the following key parameters will be estimable within the precision
         indicated (figures presented are margin of error = half width of 95% confidence interval):
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">a. the recruitment rate of participants from within smokers attending trial centres/hospital
         to within +/− 1%,
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">b. for individual trial groups, proportion of participants with validated smoking
         cessation between 4&nbsp;weeks after randomisation until late pregnancy to within +/− 4%,
         and
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">c. for both trial groups, the combined proportion of participants who quit in late
         pregnancy (cessation as defined above) to within +/− 3%, assuming that the actual
         proportion of participants quitting is around 10%.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">2. 
         <em>Estimate for short-term efficacy</em></p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">A secondary objective of this pilot trial is to estimate the effectiveness of the
         MiQuit intervention for promoting smoking cessation. Providing evidence to support
         the notion that this intervention is likely to be effective would increase the research
         team’s future chances of obtaining funding to conduct a definitive trial. We will
         investigate efficacy of MiQuit at 4&nbsp;weeks after randomisation by comparing self-reported,
         7-day, point-prevalence, cessation rates between trial groups. It should be noted
         that this is a surrogate end point for that which we plan to use in any definitive
         trial; a potential strength of using this is that event rates (that is, proportion
         of participants achieving cessation) are likely to be higher at this time point, which
         is closer to randomisation than the late pregnancy-assessment point, and this could
         provide greater power to detect between group differences. A potential disadvantage
         is that the relationship between this surrogate endpoint and cessation in late pregnancy
         (approx 36&nbsp;weeks) is not known; consequently, findings using data obtained at this
         time point should not be used in isolation to assess whether or not a definitive trial
         should be conducted. Consequently, using 95% and 80% confidence intervals (CIs), Tables&nbsp;<a name="d73565e983"></a><a onclick="popup('http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/29/table/T2','',800,470); return false;" href="http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/29/table/T2">2</a> and <a name="d73565e986"></a><a onclick="popup('http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/29/table/T3','',800,470); return false;" href="http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/29/table/T3">3</a> illustrate for this trial with 400 participants, the precision for detecting different
         ORs representing differences between groups over a range of control group event (that
         is, quit) rates. The choices of parameters for the tables are explained below.
         
         
      </p><div class="figs">
      <div class="table"><p><a onclick="popup('http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/29/table/T2','T2',800,470); return false;" href="http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/29/table/T2"><strong>Table 2.</strong></a> <strong>Estimates for treatment effect: precision estimates presented as 95% confidence intervals</strong></div>

      <p style="line-height:160%"><em>Control group event (quit) rates</em>: There are few data with which we can estimate control group event (that is, proportion
         of participants achieving cessation) rates at 1&nbsp;month after randomisation, but accurate
         estimates are important to inform meaningful sample size estimates. One recent trial
         (MiQuit feasibility trial), tested a very similar version of this trial’s intervention,
         but in this study 7-day point-prevalence abstinence was measured in similar manner
         as we propose at <em>12&nbsp;weeks</em> after randomisation, rather than at 1&nbsp;month after; in this trial, the control group
         quit rate was 19.6% <a name="d73565e1141"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B11'); return false;" href="#B11">11</a>]. Two recent UK trials have enrolled pregnant smokers, albeit with different characteristics,
         and have measured cessation outcomes at 1&nbsp;month after randomisation. A trial of nicotine
         patches found a 14% control group rate of self-reported, <em>prolonged</em> cessation between randomisation and 1&nbsp;month <a name="d73565e1148"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B18'); return false;" href="#B18">18</a>], and control group women recruited to an exercise intervention RCT had a 13.7% validated
         abstinence rate, again for reported, <em>prolonged</em> abstinence during the same period (unpublished findings) <a name="d73565e1156"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B19'); return false;" href="#B19">19</a>]. Overall, therefore, assuming that control group quit rates will fall within in a
         10 to 20% range seems reasonable.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">3. 
         <em>Estimates for treatment effect</em></p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">MiQuit is a self-help intervention and a systematic review of self-help interventions
         used for smoking cessation in pregnancy found a pooled estimate for the effectiveness
         of these, which corresponds to an Odds Ratio (OR) and (95% CI) in favour of using
         such interventions of 1.83 (1.23 to 2.73) <a name="d73565e1167"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B7'); return false;" href="#B7">7</a>]. Using data obtained at 3&nbsp;months after randomisation, the MiQuit feasibility trial
         found an OR in favour of using MiQuit of 1.68 (0.66 to 4.31) <a name="d73565e1171"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B11'); return false;" href="#B11">11</a>]. Consequently, using a range of OR from 1.3 to 1.8 is appropriate.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%"><em>Estimating cessation in late pregnancy:</em> For modelling analyses, we will use a trial-derived estimate for the treatment effect
         of the intervention derived from between-group differences in validated, longer term
         quit rates, measured in late pregnancy (that is, at approximately 36&nbsp;weeks gestation).
         Again deriving this estimate is a secondary objective of the trial. Tables&nbsp;<a name="d73565e1178"></a><a onclick="popup('http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/29/table/T4','',800,470); return false;" href="http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/29/table/T4">4</a> and <a name="d73565e1181"></a><a onclick="popup('http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/29/table/T5','',800,470); return false;" href="http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/29/table/T5">5</a> use 95% and 80% confidence intervals (CIs), to illustrate for this trial with 400
         participants, the precision for detecting different ORs representing differences between
         groups over a range of control group event (that is, proportion of participants achieving
         cessation) rates. The proportion of participants in the control group who quit is
         based on 5% and 10%, as this reflects findings in the three trials described above
         <a name="d73565e1185"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B11'); return false;" href="#B11">11</a>],<a name="d73565e1189"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B18'); return false;" href="#B18">18</a>],<a name="d73565e1193"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B19'); return false;" href="#B19">19</a>].

      <h4>Data analysis</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Members of the research team, led by the study statistician, will undertake the analyses.
         A full statistical analysis plan will be finalised and agreed by the Trial Steering
         Committee prior to data analysis. Initially, participants in the two intervention
         groups will be described separately with respect to the following:
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">1. Centre</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">2. Age at randomisation</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">3. Ethnic group (white, other)</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">4. Gestation at randomisation (&lt;16&nbsp;weeks, 16+ weeks)</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">5. Heaviness of smoking</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">6. Number of births beyond 24&nbsp;weeks,</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">7. Previous history of prenatal smoking</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">8. Partner/significant other’s smoking status</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">9. Participant’s health status (EQ5D)</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">10.  Participant’s motivation to quit</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Analyses will primarily address the feasibility objectives of the study. We will determine
         the recruitment rate, with 95% confidence intervals, of participants who take part
         in the study from pregnant smokers attending trial centre. For each trial treatment
         group, we will estimate the proportions of participants, with 95% confidence intervals,
         achieving validated smoking cessation between 4&nbsp;weeks after randomisation until late
         pregnancy (at approximately 36&nbsp;weeks gestation). We will also estimate the proportion
         of participants, with 95% confidence intervals, who achieve validated smoking cessation
         in late pregnancy (approximately at 36&nbsp;weeks gestation) for both trial groups combined.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">We will perform chi-squared tests to assess the association for the proportion of
         participants who achieve 4-week and late-pregnancy smoking outcomes between the trial
         treatment groups. Logistic regression models will then be used to compare the outcomes
         between the two trial groups with adjustment for factors used to stratify the randomisation
         (centre and gestation at randomisation; &lt;16&nbsp;weeks versus ≥16&nbsp;weeks) through including
         these as fixed covariates in the model. These analyses will be pragmatic and based
         on intention-to-treat. Additionally, we will create the following graphs to look at
         the pattern of the outcome response across centres:
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">1. Average outcome in the intervention group versus the average outcome in the control
         group per centre.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">2. Average difference in outcome between the intervention and control groups per centre
         versus centre.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Further multiple logistic regression analyses will be conducted to assess the strength
         of association between baseline covariates and 4-week and late-pregnancy smoking outcomes,
         which will include the following:
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">1. Heaviness of smoking.</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">2. Partner/significant other’s smoking status.</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">3. Education as a measure of SES.</p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">These variables have been chosen as potentially requiring adjustment because, in previous
         studies, they have been shown to be associated with smoking cessation in pregnancy
         <a name="d73565e1386"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B20'); return false;" href="#B20">20</a>],<a name="d73565e1390"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B21'); return false;" href="#B21">21</a>].
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Other smoking outcomes will be analysed using similar methods: 95% confidence intervals
         will be presented along with exact two-sided <em>P</em> values. Descriptive analyses will be performed to assess the effect of the intervention
         on the use of NHS cessation support, use of interactive features of the intervention
         and social cognitive variables.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">We also plan to explore the mechanism of effect for the MiQuit intervention that is,
         how the intervention might change smoking behaviour. For this, we will undertake mediation
         analyses to explore whether potential changes in social cognitive determinants of
         smoking cessation explain changes in quitting behaviour. This will be a secondary
         analysis and, therefore, covered in a separate paper rather than in the main trial
         outcomes paper.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Health economic analysis will investigate the potential incremental cost-effectiveness
         of MiQuit using costs (actual and estimated) of delivering the intervention and estimates
         for its effectiveness derived from the trial. Models developed in previous studies
         will be used to project the likely cessation rates into longer term estimates of life
         years gained.
      </p>
      <h4>Assessment of efficacy</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The smoking outcome measure used to estimate efficacy will be self-reported, prolonged
         abstinence from smoking from 4&nbsp;weeks after randomisation until late pregnancy, validated
         by exhaled CO and/or saliva cotinine estimation. Smoking up to five cigarettes during
         the abstinence period will be permitted and consistent with a positive outcome.
      </p>
      <h4>Assessment of safety</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">As this evaluation concerns a behavioural intervention we are not assessing any safety
         variables or collecting any adverse events.
      </p>
      <h4>Procedures for missing, unused and spurious data</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Our primary analyses will use an intention-to-treat approach, analysing all participants’
         outcome data within the intervention group to which they were randomised, assuming,
         as is consistent with the Russell Standard, that participants with missing smoking
         status data are smoking <a name="d73565e1422"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B13'); return false;" href="#B13">13</a>]. Participants are advised to withdraw from the study if they have a miscarriage or
         still birth or where the infant has died following birth; however, if they do not
         and this is established at follow-up they may decline to provide information. These
         women will be included in the analyses and assumed to be smoking.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">For the descriptive analyses, where there are missing baseline socio-demographic data,
         a separate category will be created and reported to represent the missing data. For
         statistical analyses involving socio-demographic variables with missing data, if the
         proportion of missing data is &lt;5% and roughly similar in both intervention groups,
         then we will explore the robustness of using a complete-case analysis and an analysis
         including allowing for the missing data through analysing missing data as a separate
         category. If &gt;5% of socio-demographic data are missing, then we will consider using
         imputation methods, such as multiple imputations. The impact of the imputations methods
         will be assessed fully in sensitivity analyses.
      </p>
      <h4>Definition of populations analysed</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">For the efficacy and cost-effectiveness estimate assessments, all randomised participants
         will be used in the analyses using intention-to-treat population as defined below.
         All participants in the intention-to-treat population will be used for establishing
         use of NHS smoking cessation support and for the mechanism of effect analysis.
      </p>
      <h4>Intention-to-treat population</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The intention-to-treat (ITT) population is defined for this trial as all pregnant
         smokers who were randomised into the trial. Participants will be analysed based on
         the intervention group to which they were randomised. For participants with missing
         smoking-related outcomes, we will use the Russell Standard, where these participants
         will be assumed to be smoking <a name="d73565e1440"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B13'); return false;" href="#B13">13</a>].
      </p>
      <h4>Sensitivity analyses</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Two populations will be used for the sensitivity analyses on the 4-week and late-pregnancy
         smoking outcome measures:
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">1. All pregnant smokers who were randomised into the trial, and who have outcome data
         available for analysis (complete case analysis). Participants will be analysed based
         on the intervention group to which they were randomised.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">2. All pregnant smokers who were randomised into the trial, and who, in the intervention
         group, self-reported at follow up that they received the intervention leaflet and
         text messages (per protocol analysis).
      </p>
      <h4>Health economics</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Per-participant costs of providing the MiQuit service will be calculated. and EQ-5D
         data will be used with this to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of offering
         the MiQuit intervention. Given that this is a pilot study rather than a definitive
         trial, it is acknowledged that the estimate for incremental cost-effectiveness will
         have limited accuracy and so a range of different potential values will be used to
         model the potential lifetime cost effectiveness of introducing MiQuit into routine
         clinical practice. Modelling will use i) estimates for uptake of NHS services by smokers
         and non-smokers after pregnancy, which have been derived from a similar recent trial
         that employed post-partum follow up <a name="d73565e1460"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B18'); return false;" href="#B18">18</a>], and ii) a model, which values smoking cessation in pregnancy in economic terms and
         is currently being developed by a PhD student.
      </p>
      <h4>Data management</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Data will be entered electronically on a trial specific database. Only research midwives
         and the research study team will have database access, which permits them to make
         new entries and also to access relevant personal data collected from participants
         at their sites (for example, contact details).
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">To enable anonymisation, each participant will be assigned a unique trial identity
         code number, allocated at randomisation, for use on all trial documents and the electronic
         database.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The database will be maintained on a server located within the Nottingham Clinical
         Trials Unit, University of Nottingham (Chief Investigator’s institution). The database
         has a regular back-up routine, and will be password protected.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Anonymised data, which have been sent to MiQuit and which have been used to individualise
         SMS text messages, will be held on a secure server within the Institute of Public
         Health at the University of Cambridge. Only authorised trial staff shall have access
         to trial documentation other than for the regulatory requirements.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">All trial staff and investigators will endeavour to protect the rights of the trial’s
         participants to privacy and informed consent and will adhere to the Data Protection
         Act, 1998.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Electronic data will be backed up every 24&nbsp;hours to both local and remote media in
         encrypted format. Electronic audio files of the interviews will be stored in an encrypted
         format. Transcribed interviews will be anonymised.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Monitoring of trial data shall include confirmation of informed consent; source data
         verification; data storage and data transfer procedures; local quality control checks
         and procedures, back-up and disaster recovery of any local databases and validation
         of data manipulation. The Trial Manager, or where required, a nominated designee of
         the Sponsor, shall carry out monitoring of trial data as an on-going activity.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">All records and documents regarding the conduct of the study will be retained for
         at least 7&nbsp;years or for longer if required. The trial master file and trial documents
         held by the Chief Investigator on behalf of the sponsor will be archived at secure
         archive facilities at the University of Nottingham. This archive shall include all
         trial databases and associated meta-data encryption codes.
      </p>
      <h4>Transport, storage and analysis of saliva samples</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The use of oral fluid samples (saliva) is a non-invasive way of measuring cotinine,
         a nicotine metabolite <a name="d73565e1491"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B22'); return false;" href="#B22">22</a>]. Saliva samples will be collected at visit 4 (around 36&nbsp;weeks gestation) to verify
         smoking status by a researcher or by post if a visit is not possible. Saliva samples
         will be obtained using clean salivettes; it will involve the participant placing a
         sterile swab under the tongue, for up to 5&nbsp;minutes until it is moist and then placing
         the swab into a sterile vessel. All samples will be stored in a linked anonymised
         format in a secure freezer storage unit (−20°C) within Nottingham Health Science Biobank
         (NHSB) according to their approved protocols. Where researchers obtain samples by
         visiting participants who live at a distance that would make it impractical to deliver
         these to Nottingham in person, these samples will be posted by the study team in suitable
         packaging, and when received, the study team will transfer them to NHSB. Samples are
         stable at ambient temperatures for several days. For postal samples, the participant
         will be asked to state the date they provided the sample on the label. Participants
         will be advised to return the sample (using the protective pre-paid and addressed
         packaging) on the day they provide the sample. Again these will be transferred to
         the NHSB by a member of the study team. Nottingham Health Science Biobank has been
         given full approval by the HTA to be a full licence holder, meeting all legislation
         requirements.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Once all samples have been collected for the study, NHSB will arrange transportation
         of samples by courier to ABS Laboratories Ltd, Hertfordshire for analysis in a single
         batch shipment. The shipment will contain a complete inventory of all samples, along
         with the name of the person responsible for sending the samples. The master database
         to link all samples will be held by the Nottingham study team in a password encrypted
         file. The laboratory will quantify salivary cotinine levels using a quantitative enzyme
         immunoassay technique (EIA). Once the analysis has been completed the saliva samples
         will be destroyed in accordance with the Human Tissue Act 2004, this will only occur
         once the study team have received the results and have analysed the data to ensure
         that all samples remain in a normal range and do not require retesting.
      </p>
      <h4>Dissemination</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Results will be written up for publication in peer reviewed journals and disseminated
         at local, national, and international meetings where appropriate. A lay summary will
         be produced and distributed to those participants who have indicated they would like
         to receive a copy and other interested parties.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Participants will not be identified in any publications or presentations resulting
         from this study.
      </p>
      <h4>User and public involvement</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">A Public and Patient Involvement representative has contributed to this protocol,
         to trial documents and to the development of the intervention. In addition, several
         individuals who took part in a pilot trial of MiQuit have been consulted and have
         provided guidance on the refinement and delivery of MiQuit.
      </p>
      <h4>Indemnity</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Insurance and indemnity for trial participants and trial staff is covered within the
         NHS Indemnity Arrangements for clinical negligence claims in the NHS, issued under
         cover of HSG (96)48.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The University of Nottingham as research Sponsor indemnifies its staff, research participants
         and research protocols with both public liability insurance and clinical trials insurance.
         These policies include provision for indemnity in the event of a successful litigious
         claim for proven non-negligent harm.
      </p>
      <h4>Trial management</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">The Chief Investigator has overall responsibility for the study and will oversee all
         study management. The Trial Management Group (TMG) will be responsible for the day
         to day running of the trial. The TMG will be supported by and report to an independent
         Trial Steering Committee. Trial co-ordination will be managed centrally by the study
         team based in Nottingham led by a trial manager and guided by the TMG. The Cambridge
         research team will manage a server hosting the MiQuit intervention; however, the Chief
         Investigator (Nottingham) will be custodian of all study data.
      </p>
      <h4>Ethics approval</h4>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Ethical approval for this study was granted by Nottingham 1 Research Ethics Committee
         (NRES reference 13/EM/0427).

<section><a name="sec3"></a><h3>Discussion</h3>
   <div class="collapsible-content">
      <p style="line-height:160%">Once completed, this pilot trial will provide the necessary data to plan for larger
         definitive study to investigate whether or not self-help cessation support <a name="d73565e1543"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B7'); return false;" href="#B7">7</a>] provided in an interactive text message format can help pregnant women to achieve
         cessation. This pilot trial provides information, which complements that from our
         earlier feasibility trial <a name="d73565e1547"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B11'); return false;" href="#B11">11</a>] and has been necessary for a number of reasons.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">First, the primary outcome for the earlier study was self-reported, 7-day, point-prevalence,
         smoking cessation <a name="d73565e1553"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B12'); return false;" href="#B12">12</a>] measured at 12&nbsp;weeks after trial entry <a name="d73565e1557"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B11'); return false;" href="#B11">11</a>]. Whilst any period of smoking cessation is likely to be beneficial for pregnant women
         and their infants, maximal health gain for infants is likely to occur if mothers maintain
         abstinence throughout pregnancy. Additionally, it is possible that women who remain
         smoke free for the whole of pregnancy will be better able to avoid relapse back to
         smoking after childbirth and, for both reasons, a definitive study should aim to detect
         any impact on women’s smoking throughout the whole of pregnancy. Most smoking cessation
         trials encourage participants to set a quit date and cessation outcomes are measured
         prospectively from this point; however, MiQuit is a ‘cessation-induction’ intervention,
         which encourages, but does not require users to set a definite quit date. Finding
         appropriate time points in pregnancy from which continuous cessation can be measured,
         monitored and validated, after participants have been exposed to MiQuit, is an important
         issue that the pilot trial is attempting to resolve. Achieving high ascertainment
         rates for piloted methods of measuring continuous cessation will mean that our piloted
         outcome could be used to measure and validate smoking cessation throughout the whole
         of pregnancy in any future definitive RCT.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Second, the treatment effects attributable to smoking cessation interventions are
         generally inversely proportional to their intensity <a name="d73565e1563"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B23'); return false;" href="#B23">23</a>] and MiQuit is a low-intensity intervention. For a definitive study to have sufficient
         power to show whether or not MiQuit has efficacy for smoking cessation in pregnancy,
         such a study could need a sample size of over 3,000 participants (estimated using
         data from previous MiQuit trial <a name="d73565e1567"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B11'); return false;" href="#B11">11</a>]). Clearly, to plan a definitive study that combines a sufficiently high chance of
         providing a definitive answer with efficient use of resources, the best possible information
         is needed. This pilot trial will provide the first estimate for the treatment effect
         that MiQuit might have for influencing continuous smoking cessation between earlier
         and later (approximately 36&nbsp;weeks) pregnancy; although the pilot is not powered to
         provide such an estimate with high precision, it will nevertheless, be a very valuable
         parameter. Additionally, knowing the combined treatment groups’ cessation rates at
         36&nbsp;weeks will also be useful to inform definitive-trial sample size calculations.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Third, recruitment rates from this study will be vital for assessing the feasibility
         of delivering a large definitive RCT investigating smoking cessation in pregnancy
         and using English National Health Service (NHS) research structures. Since 2006, the
         English NHS has developed and revised research networks, funded from the health service
         budget and orientated towards delivering clinical research; there is a particular
         focus on RCTs that influence clinical practice <a name="d73565e1573"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B24'); return false;" href="#B24">24</a>]. Networks provide staff working across the NHS whose remit is to recruit to research
         studies and researchers who successfully access network staff support can efficiently
         deliver multi-centre RCTs. However, negotiating access to research networks and subsequently
         finding the most efficient ways of combining their efforts with those of a university-based
         research team can be challenging and, significantly the two most recent English pregnancy
         smoking cessation trials <a name="d73565e1577"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B18'); return false;" href="#B18">18</a>],<a name="d73565e1581"></a>[<a onclick="LoadInParent('#B19'); return false;" href="#B19">19</a>] were completed with relatively little research network input. To date, overall pilot
         trial recruitment has been strong and it appears that study methods could, feasibly
         be used to recruit to a larger definitive study. However, across the 16 trial centres
         from which this pilot recruits, there has been marked variation in recruitment rates.
         Consequently, lessons learned from our planned pilot trial process evaluation should
         help us to better understand the reasons for different recruitment rates in different
         centres and, potentially to enhance the research network staff experience of recruiting
         to the trial for any future study.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height:160%">Given the nature of this pilot trial, discussion has principally focussed on methodological
         issues. However, if after this study, a definitive RCT is conducted and MiQuit is
         found to be effective for smoking cessation in pregnancy, this very cheap and likely
         (in that circumstance) highly cost-effective intervention could easily be made very
         widely available in many different ways to support smoking cessation in pregnancy.
