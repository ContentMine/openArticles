This update presents the statistical analysis plan, detailing how the study will be analyzed and presented. The statistical analysis plan has been written following recommendations from the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, prior to database lock and the final analysis of trial data.
