                  <h3>Background</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Promotion of healthy pregnancies has gained high priority in the Netherlands because
                  of relatively unfavorable perinatal outcomes. In response, a nationwide study, ‘Healthy
                  Pregnancy 4 All’ (HP4ALL), has been initiated. Part of this study involves systematic
                  and broadened antenatal risk assessment (the Risk Assessment substudy). Risk selection
                  in current clinical practice is mainly based on medical risk factors. Despite the
                  increasing evidence for the influence of nonmedical risk factors (social status, lifestyle
                  or ethnicity) on perinatal outcomes, these risk factors remain highly unexposed. Systematic
                  risk selection, combined with customized care pathways to reduce or treat detected
                  risks, and regular and structured consultation between community midwives, gynecologists
                  and other care providers such as social workers, is part of this study.

               </div>
               <p>Neighborhoods in 14 municipalities with adverse perinatal outcomes above national
                  and municipal averages are selected for participation. The study concerns a cluster
                  randomized controlled trial. Municipalities are randomly allocated to intervention
                  (n = 3,500 pregnant women) and control groups (n = 3,500 pregnant women). The intervention
                  consists of systematic risk selection with the Rotterdam Reproductive Risk Reduction
                  (R4U) score card in pregnant women at the booking visit, and referral to corresponding
                  care pathways. A risk score, based on weighed risk factors derived from the R4U, above
                  a predefined threshold determines structured multidisciplinary consultation. Primary
                  outcomes of this trial are dysmaturity (birth weight &lt; p10), prematurity (birth &lt;37 weeks),
                  and efficacy of implementation.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Perinatal mortality rates in the Netherlands are higher than in other European countries
         and are showing a slower rate of decline 
         				
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. The latest confirmed statistics describe a perinatal mortality rate (deaths from
         22 weeks of gestation up to 7 days postpartum) of 8.5 per 1,000 births 
         				
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. In addition, higher risks for adverse outcomes were found for women living in socioeconomically
         deprived areas, particularly in the four largest cities in the Netherlands 
         				
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>. The adverse perinatal health outcome in the Netherlands has triggered debates and
         initiatives to study and intervene in possible causes for these adverse outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>More than 85 percent of all causes of perinatal mortality in the Netherlands are associated
         with four adverse perinatal outcomes, namely congenital disorders, small for gestational
         age (birth weight &lt;10th percentile for gestational age), premature delivery (birth
         &lt;37 weeks), and/or a suboptimal start at birth (Apgar score &lt;7 after 5 minutes); these
         are defined as the ‘Big 4’ outcomes 
         				
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>. Poor outcomes were especially observed in deprived districts and are often associated
         with socioeconomic and ethnicity related risk factors such as low education, low income
         and poor integration into society

            <h3>The Dutch system</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The Dutch antenatal healthcare system is divided into three levels of care in which
            a distinction is made between low-risk and high-risk pregnancies. The primary level
            of care, antenatal health care is provided by independently practicing midwives who
            deliver care to pregnant women with an uncomplicated pregnancy, childbirth and the
            postpartum period. These women are estimated to be ‘low risk’. If complications (threaten
            to) occur, midwives refer the women to a gynecologist at the secondary level of care
            
            					
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
            </span>. The tertiary level of care takes place in centers for perinatology with a neonatal
            intensive care unit and an obstetric ‘high-care’ department. The latter is reserved
            for severely ill women or threatened pregnancies

            <h3>Current practice of risk selection</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Current risk selection during the antenatal period focuses on medical risk factors
            
            					
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
               <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
            </span>. A list of obstetric indications, for which referral from primary to secondary care
            is prescribed, has been composed by professionals involved in the field. On this list,
            the most frequently occurring medical conditions and prior obstetric complications
            are allocated to the different levels of care. The composition of this list was based
            on best evidence or best practices. Since the last update in 2003, there has been
            an increase in evidence of the influence of nonmedical risk factors (social status,
            lifestyle or ethnicity) on adverse perinatal outcomes 
            					
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
            </span>. These risk factors are usually not considered in current risk screening practices.
            Moreover, it was shown that an accumulation of these risk factors can even further
            harm the chances of a good pregnancy outcome. This phenomenon implies that the presence
            of a number of smaller risk factors, rather than a single greater one, increases the
            risk on adverse perinatal outcomes

            <h3>Initiatives to improve perinatal health</h3>
         </div>
         <p>To improve perinatal health, especially in socially deprived districts, the Rotterdam
            municipal council and health scientists of the Erasmus University Medical Centre initiated
            a city-wide perinatal health program ‘Ready for Baby’ in 2009 
            					
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
            </span>. The ‘Ready for Baby’ program provided the framework for this national study. It
            was within this program that scorecard-based risk screening and corresponding care
            pathways were developed and piloted. Within the context of this program, the Rotterdam
            area served as a testing ground for a number of experiments, including the development
            and piloting of the R4U (Rotterdam Reproductive Risk Reduction) scorecard for antenatal
            risk screening 
            					
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
            </span>. These former experiences were used to further improve and implement these tools
            in other municipalities with high perinatal mortality and morbidity in the Healthy
            Pregnancy 4 All study. The Healthy Pregnancy 4 All study was launched in 2011 by the
            Erasmus University Medical Centre in 14 municipalities in the Netherlands. It focuses
            on preconception care and broadened risk selection during pregnancy 
            					
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">

         </p>
         <p>In the risk assessment substudy, we will implement and investigate the Rotterdam Reproductive
            Risk Reduction (R4U) scorecard, corresponding care pathways and multidisciplinary
            consultation. This score card focuses on both medical and nonmedical risk factors,
            including psychological, social, lifestyle, obstetric and nonobstetric care-related
            risks. During the first antenatal visit, the R4U scorecard will be assessed by a midwife
            or gynecologist. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of this
            new approach in antenatal health care on perinatal outcomes.

         <p>The study design concerns a cluster randomized controlled trial at the municipality
            level. Selected municipalities are randomly allocated to intervention and control
            groups. The intervention comprises systematic risk selection with the R4U scorecard
            in pregnant women at the booking visit and referral to the corresponding care pathways.
            A risk score, based on weighed risk factors derived from the R4U, above a predefined
            threshold determines consultation among community midwives, gynecologists, and other
            care providers, such as social workers in a multidisciplinary setting.
         </p>
         <p>The study aims 1) to investigate the effectiveness of systematic approach in antenatal
            health care on adverse pregnancy outcomes (primarily lowering prematurity and small
            for gestational age outcomes) and 2) the efficacy of implementation (measured by the

         </div>
         <p>The selection of neighborhoods is based on the presence of an elevated incidence of
            adverse perinatal outcomes (above both the national and municipal average). Municipalities
            are extracted after a selection process in which zip codes with high adverse perinatal
            outcomes are identified in a thorough analysis. For this analysis, data from all singleton
            pregnancies in the Netherlands over the period of 2000 to 2008 were obtained with
            permission from the Dutch Perinatal Registry (PRN)

         <p>All midwives and gynecologists providing care to women living in these zip codes will
            be invited to participate in the Healthy Pregnancy 4 All study. All pregnant women
            living in these selected areas are eligible for this trial. All municipalities deal
            with an above-average perinatal mortality rate and many disadvantaged neighborhoods.
            Exclusion criteria include an acute obstetric situation during the booking visit (for
            example, ectopic pregnancy) and women in labor during this initial visit.

            <h3>Study design</h3>
         </div>
         <p>To prevent contamination, we have randomized on the level of municipalities instead
            of (1) on the level of midwife practices or (2) on the level of hospitals or obstetric
            collaborations.
         </p>
         <p>Randomization at the level of the individual patient is not possible because of contamination
            to a healthcare professional: a care provider will not be able to distinguish between
            intervention and control participants within their practice.
         </p>
         <p>Many midwife practices are cooperating with hospitals in so-called obstetric collaborations
            (OC’s). Randomization on the level of OC’s was also not an option: hospitals are always
            involved in one particular OC, but midwife practices can participate in more than
            one OC. This is especially the case in municipalities with more than one hospital.

            <h3>Intervention and control</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Use of the R4U scorecard, corresponding care pathways, and multidisciplinary consultation
            will be compared with conventional antenatal health care. In municipalities allocated
            to the intervention group, midwives and gynecologists will use the R4U scorecard during
            every first antenatal visit (provided that informed consent is given). The R4U scorecard
            consists of six domains (social status, ethnicity, care, lifestyle, medical history
            and obstetric history), subdivided into 70 items. The R4U scorecard is proposed to
            facilitate improved coordination of antenatal care through systematic and uniform
            risk screening for medical and nonmedical risk factors. A risk score, based on risk
            factors derived from the R4U, above the predefined cut-off point implies follow-up
            action. This follow-up action includes multidisciplinary consultation between obstetric
            caregivers and nonobstetric caregivers (for example, social workers) and prioritization
            of risk factors. For each cluster, this cut-off point will be calculated after a pilot
            of 50 R4U scorecards have been completed in a municipality. We strive to assess 20%
            of all pregnant women in this multidisciplinary setting. Healthcare professionals
            determine when and how to organize these meetings, with a minimum frequency of once
            a month. A standardized format is available to discuss a patient in such meetings.
            The purpose of these meetings is to assess a customized antenatal policy for each
            individual pregnant woman.
         </p>
         <p>We developed 28 templates of care pathways for all risk factors incorporated in the
            R4U score card. Care pathways consist of steps a caregiver could follow to meet specific
            needs for pregnant women. Together with local healthcare professionals from both the
            perinatal care, community health services (called the GGD), and other services, these
            templates will be adapted to local circumstances. Local facilities, agreements, and
            guidelines will be incorporated. Depending on local availability, care pathways will
            developed for all items as presented in the R4U scorecard. These created care pathways
            will support the individual healthcare professional to encounter complex (non-) medical
            risk factors. They can also facilitate the collaboration among different healthcare
            professionals and professionals within the community health services.
         </p>
         <p>Pregnant women in the control group will receive conventional antenatal health care.
            After the inclusion of 700 participants or after two-thirds of our study period (2 years),
            we will end the control group in a particular municipality and will start with the
            implementation of the R4U scorecard and corresponding care pathways. As mentioned
            in our introduction, several studies revealed a disadvantaged position of the Netherlands
            regarding perinatal mortality. For the first time, the unique organization of antenatal
            care in the Netherlands was openly questioned. In response, health care professionals
            and policy makers were urged to undertake interventions. The fact that we made municipalities
            aware of their perinatal health statistics and allocated them to be ‘a control’ was
            contradictory to ambitions to intervene, as the control status was felt to be the
            negligent attitude of local health authorities.
         </p>
         <p>We are lenient to this aspect and will offer them the opportunity to start with the
            intervention after they have reached a certain amount of included subjects or at two-thirds
            of the way through the study. Therefore, we aim to implement and facilitate this new
            approach in all 14 municipalities at the end of the study period. This implies that
            the study design remains a parallel trial in which only pregnancy outcomes from regular
            antenatal health care in control municipalities will be analyzed. Pregnancy outcomes
            of women enrolled after the ‘cross-over’ in control municipalities (that is, women
            in control municipalities that were exposed the intervention) will not be analyzed
            for this purpose.

            <h3>Procedures, recruitment, randomization, and collection of baseline data</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Randomization took place in January 2011 by an independent statistician who was not
            involved in executing the study. In order to decide whether matching was necessary,
            in each cluster, the adverse perinatal outcomes (Big 4 and perinatal mortality) were
            stratified according to socioeconomic status and ethnicity. Since clusters were not
            considerably different in terms of these characteristics, we decided that matching
            of clusters for socio-economic status and ethnicity was unnecessary.
         </p>
         <p>As stated before, midwife practices participate in OC’s. Due to merging plans between
            OC’s in the north of the Netherlands, four small municipalities and one large municipality
            were combined and form one cluster (named Groningen). Thus, ten municipalities were
            randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 5) or the control group (n = 5).
         </p>
         <p>In the randomization procedure, municipalities were numbered according to the expected
            number at risk. Hereby, we ensured that both arms of the experiment were comparable
            in size. Five random numbers were drawn from the uniform distribution between zero
            and one. If the number was below 0.5, the first of the pair would be assigned to the
            intervention, otherwise to the control group. The clusters Amsterdam, Tilburg, Groningen,
            Enschede and Nijmegen are allocated as intervention municipalities. The clusters for
            The Hague, Schiedam, Heerlen, Almere and Utrecht are control municipalities. The randomization
            scheme is available as an additional file (see Additional file

         <p>The logistics are carried out in close collaboration with participating local program
            coordinators, midwives, gynecologists, and, if available, research midwives in the
            14 participating municipalities. Eligible women will receive participant information,
            and they will be asked for written consent to collect data on their pregnancy outcomes
            by the participating healthcare professionals. These healthcare professionals will
            register all participating women anonymously by a study number in a web-based database.
            We will ask to register the 4-digit zip code, maternal age, gestational age at booking
            visit, and certain items of the obstetric history. All women participating in the
            risk assessment study within the HP4ALL study will receive either one or two questionnaires.
            The first questionnaire contains questions regarding baseline characteristics, such
            as marital status, household composition and income, education level, ethnicity, lifestyle
            (smoking, alcohol, and drug use), use of folic acid, medical history, and use of medication.
            This questionnaire will be completed around the first antenatal visit (depending on
            local logistics). The second questionnaire focuses on satisfaction. In this questionnaire,
            we will investigate patient satisfaction regarding their first antenatal visit. We
            compare satisfaction in participants in the intervention group with participants receiving
            conventional antenatal health care. This questionnaire will be completed by a selection
            of study participants. We will ask all participating practices/hospitals to distribute
            this questionnaire in a predefined time period of 3 months to all study participants
            having their third antenatal visit. This visit is before the so-called 20-week ultrasound.
            With this timing, we try to avoid bias in answering the questionnaire due to outcomes
            resulting from this ultrasound.
         </p>
         <p>To provide baseline characteristics from participating healthcare professionals, an
            interview will be performed with one healthcare professional from each participating
            midwifery practice and hospital. In this structured interview, we will collect data
            on the number of patients and employees, the current use of risk-selection instruments,
            collaboration with hospitals and (other) midwifery practices in OC’s, and work processes
            in their antenatal healthcare (for example, counseling for prenatal screening, or
            ultrasound facilities). This will be repeated at the end of the study. We will use
            the Relational Coordination survey to measure the coordination performance of healthcare
            professionals. Gittell’s theory of Relational Coordination has been developed for
            measuring coordination performance among different professions. The healthcare professionals
            will be surveyed about their communication and relationships with other healthcare
            professionals during the antenatal phase. This will allow us to observe the effect
            of our intervention on the coordination performance of healthcare professionals

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The primary outcomes are small for gestational age, preterm birth, and efficacy of
            implementation. Small for gestational age is defined as birth weight below the 10th
            percentile for gestational age. Preterm birth is defined as birth before 37 weeks
            of gestation.
         </p>
         <p>Efficacy of implementation will be measured by the number of R4Us completed by the
            healthcare professional against the number of booking visits, the development and
            use of care pathways, actual performed multidisciplinary consultations, and patient
            and healthcare professional satisfaction. Primary outcomes, except for patient satisfaction,
            will be recorded by healthcare professionals or the project team after delivery on
            case record forms in an electronic database.
         </p>
         <p>Secondary outcomes are perinatal mortality (from the 22th week of gestation until
            7 days postpartum), undetected small for gestational age and unexpected preterm births
            (babies born in the first level of care), and prevalence and accumulation of medical
            and nonmedical risk factors.
         </p>
         <p>Other outcome parameters are: detection and prevention of impaired growth and preterm
            birth during pregnancy, delivery modus, place of delivery, involved healthcare professionals,
            congenital anomalies, neonatal admission, asphyxia, maternal morbidity (such as pre-existing
            chronic disease, pregnancy complications, and positive booking bloods) and maternal
            mortality.

            follow-up will be recorded after 6 weeks in a case record form. If necessary, medical
            records of newborns will be requested (if consent is provided).

            </div>
            <p>The sample size is determined by focusing on the primary objective of the trial: the
               effectiveness of systematic antenatal screening on adverse small for gestational age
               (&lt;10th percentile) and preterm birth (gestational age below 37 weeks). In this cluster-randomized
               trial, sample size depends on (1) the average risk of small for gestational age and
               preterm birth without the intervention (π
               <sub>0</sub>); (2) the expected effect of the intervention (π
               <sub>1</sub>); (3) the inflation factor reflecting the partial similarity/dependency of women’s
               outcomes or responses within the same cluster; (4) the α; and (5) power (1-β) of the
               test.

               </span>, the average prevalence in our selected zip code areas in the years 2000 to 2008
               was 16.7%. In the intervention group, we expect a prevalence of 13% at the end of
               the study period. The average prevalence of both primary outcomes in the Netherlands
               was 12% for the years 2000 to 2008

               the degree of similarity among responses within a cluster. With five municipalities
               in each group (a total of ten clusters) and an alpha of 0.05 (two-sided test), 7,000
               participants (3,500 per arm) should provide power in excess of 80%. This means 700
               women are needed per cluster. It is assumed that a difference of 150 to 200 participants
               between the larger and smaller clusters has no implications for the outcome

               versus conventional antenatal healthcare (measured as the difference in small for
               gestational age and preterm birth between both groups) will be assessed by using multilevel
               logistic regression with random effects. Results will be presented as effect estimates
               with a measure of precision (95% confidence interval). Data will be analyzed anonymously
               on two levels: the maternal and the municipal level. To guarantee anonymity, we will
               not analyze the data on community practice or at the hospital level. Study participants,
               municipalities, and community practices or hospitals will not be traceable. Other
               analyses related to our intervention are based on differences in other birth outcomes
               (for example, Apgar score), the number of referrals between community midwives and
               gynecologists, adequacy in risk assessment (for example, detection of growth restriction
               in the antenatal phase), and the contribution of nonmedical risk factors to adverse
               birth outcomes between the intervention and control group. These outcomes will be
               assessed with univariate and multivariate regression analysis with 95% confidence

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The main objective of this trial is to investigate the effectiveness of a new systematic
         approach in antenatal healthcare on adverse pregnancy outcomes and efficacy of implementation.
         We will implement and investigate the Rotterdam Reproductive Risk Reduction (R4U)
         scorecard and corresponding care pathways in 14 municipalities.
      </p>
      <p>The study meets the current evidence to intervene early in pregnancy upon (modifiable)
         risk factors associated with adverse perinatal health outcomes. We aim to target a
         population that potentially will benefit the most with the use of selected geographical
         areas. With the use of care pathways, optimal linkage is sought between curative and
         preventive care, such as public health, government, and social welfare organizations
         
         				
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>To our knowledge, this is the first approach in antenatal healthcare whereby systematic
         risk selection for both medical and nonmedical risk factors, variable thresholds,
         tailor-made care pathways, and structured consultation between midwives, gynecologists
         and other care providers are combined. This study will introduce a systematic approach
         in antenatal health care, which may improve perinatal outcomes and, thereby, future
         health status of a new generation in the Netherlands.
