                  <h3>Background</h3>
               </div>
               <p>There is a consensus that exercise therapy should be used as a therapeutic approach
                  in chronic low back pain (CLBP) but little consensus has been reached about the preferential
                  type of therapy. Due to the heterogeneity of the population no clear effect of specific
                  therapy interventions are found. Probably a specific subgroup of the investigated
                  population will benefit from the intervention and another subgroup will not benefit,
                  looking at the total investigated population no significant effects can be found.
                  Therefore there is a need for the development of clinical prediction rules (CPRs).
                  Objectives for this trial are first, the derivation of CPRs to predict treatment response
                  to three forms of exercise therapy for patients with nonspecific CLBP. Secondly, we
                  aim to validate a CPR for the three forms of exercise therapy for patients with nonspecific
                  CLBP.

                  <h3>Methods/Design</h3>
               </div>
               <p>The study design is a randomized controlled trial. Patients with nonspecific CLBP
                  of more than three months duration are recruited at the Antwerp University Hospital
                  (Belgium) and Apra Rehabilitation Hospital. After examination, patients are randomly
                  assigned to one of three intervention groups: motor control therapy, general active
                  exercise therapy and isometric training therapy. All patients will undergo 18 treatment
                  sessions during nine weeks. Measurements will be taken at baseline, nine weeks, six
                  months and at one year. The primary outcome used is the Modified Oswestry Disability
                  Questionnaire score. For each type of exercise therapy a CPR will be derived and validated.
                  For validation, the CPR will be applied to divide each treatment group into two subgroups
                  (matched and unmatched therapy) using the baseline measurements. We predict a better
                  therapeutic effect for matched therapy.

               <p>A randomized controlled trial has not previously been performed for the development
                  of a CPR for exercise therapy in CLBP patients. Only one CPR was described in a single-arm
                  design for motor control therapy in sub-acute non-radicular LBP patients. In this
                  study, a sufficiently large sample will be included in both the derivation and validation
                  phase.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Low back pain (LBP) can be considered as an epidemic 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. The European guidelines mention a lifetime prevalence of 84% 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. About 5 to 10% of LBP patients develop chronic low back pain (CLBP), and 85% of
         these patients have nonspecific LBP 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. Based on the European guidelines 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span> nonspecific CLBP is defined as pain and discomfort localised below the costal margin
         and above the inferior gluteal folds, with or without referred leg pain, persisting
         for at least 12 weeks. Nonspecific LBP is not attributable to a known specific pathology
         such as infection, tumor, osteoporosis, fracture, structural deformity, inflammatory
         disorder (for example, ankylosing spondylitis), radicular syndrome or cauda equine
         syndrome.
      </p>
      <p>The large group of patients meeting these criteria is heterogeneous and therefore
         these patients represent a treatment challenge for every clinician. There is a consensus
         that exercise therapy should be used as a therapeutic approach 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span> but little consensus has been reached about the preferential type of therapy 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>

            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span>. Due to the heterogeneity of the population no clear effect of specific therapy interventions
         are found. Probably a specific subgroup of the investigated population will benefit
         from the intervention and another subgroup will not benefit, looking at the total
         investigated population no significant effects can be found. In response to this,
         the European guidelines 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span> express the need for the development of tools which improve the classification and
         identification of specific clinical sub-groups of nonspecific CLBP patients.

      <p>Haskins 
         <i>et al</i>. 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">15</span>
         </span> described 23 existing studies on clinical prediction rules (CPR) in LBP patients.
         Only two of those studies describe the development of CPR’s for active rehabilitation
         in LBP patients. One of those two discusses a McKenzie approach, which is not our
         point of interest since we are focusing on motor control therapy, general active exercises
         therapy and isometric training therapy.
      </p>
      <p>The other study, Hicks 
         <i>et al</i>. 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span>, developed two preliminary CPR’s in recurrent LBP patients: one for the success and
         one for the absence of success of motor control therapy. They performed a single-arm
         intervention study (no control group only motor control therapy) on 54 recurrent non-radicular
         LBP patients. After therapy, 39 patients were classified as ‘improved’ and 15 patients
         were classified as ‘not improved’. Multivariate regression analysis resulted in four
         positive prediction factors for motor control therapy. Presence of three or more of
         the predicting factors led to a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 4.0 (95% CI: 1.6
         to 10.0) and increased the post-test probability of success with motor control therapy
         from 33 to 67%. Also, four negative predicting factors with motor control therapy
         were detected. The presence of two or more predicting factors led to a negative likelihood
         ratio (LR–) of 0.18 (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.38).

         The patients that were assigned to an intervention group that, according to the CPR,
         was the best suitable therapy were considered as test patients (matched). They concluded
         larger improvements on the Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (MODI) by the
         patients following the matched treatment, in comparison with those following the unmatched
         therapy, both at short and longer term (four and 52 weeks, respectively).
      </p>
      <p>The implementation and validation of a CPR can lead to a decrease of health complaints
         and an increased quality of life for numerous patients. A higher number and a faster
         return to work, or less frequent absence of work over time, are expected. If the patient-customized
         therapy leads to a decrease of recurrence this can lead to a decrease in direct and
         indirect health costs.
      </p>
      <p>Our research question is the development (derivation) and validation of a CPR for
         the choice of an exercise therapy type (motor control therapy, general active exercise
         therapy and isometric training therapy) in nonspecific CLBP patients. Based on the
         derived CPR, subgroups will be made, ultimately leading to detection of patients with
         a high chance for success with a certain type of exercise therapy. The CPR will be
         developed according to the correct methodological phases

            <h3>Study design</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The development of a CPR consists of three consecutive phases. The first two are the
            derivation and validation phase.In the derivation phase a CPR is derived from a number
            of variables that have predictive potential for therapy outcome. These variables are
            obtained from baseline measurements and have a multidimensional character (impairments,
            activities and/or participation and contextual factors). Data analysis is being used
            to calculate the most powerful combination of these variables to finally form the
            new derived CPR (see Figure 
            <div tagx="figr">1</div> and ‘Data analysis’).In the validation phase the derived CPR will be applied in a
            new study population. This application will result in matched patients (allocated
            in accordance with the CPR) and in unmatched patients (not in accordance with the
            CPR). The treatment success of both groups will be compared. The hypothesis is that
            treatment success will be higher in the matched group (Figure 
            <div tagx="figr">2</div>).

               replaces the sex life item with an employment or homemaking item and has an excellent

            <p>2. Measurement of limitations in activities and participation: hours of physical activity
               per week (trough anamnesis). Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF36), Roland Morris Disability
               Questionnaire (RMDQ).

         <p>In both phases patients will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups
            after baseline testing. The responsible researcher will use a randomization list generated
            with Microsoft Excel® software (version 14.3.9, Microsoft Corporation, Zaventem, Belgium).
            Physiotherapists responsible for the treatment sessions are blinded for the results
            of baseline and follow-up measurements, which are being performed by the responsible
            researcher.In the validation phase a pre stratification will be used to ensure a 50:50
            ratio between matched and unmatched therapy within one intervention group. Patients
            who have a strong preference for one of our intervention groups and therefore cannot
            be randomized will be asked to participate in a parallel cohort study. In this study
            similar baseline and follow-up measurements will be used.

         <p>During the nine-week intervention, patients will be treated two times a week. Patients
            will be assigned randomly into one of three intervention groups (motor control therapy,
            general active exercise therapy and isometric training therapy). Each intervention
            will take about 70 minutes. A 10 minutes warm up and cool down period will be the
            same in each treatment regime. Each group receives 50 minutes of therapy-specific
            intervention. Previously trained physiotherapists will give the treatment. To ensure
            that all therapists provide the same exercises, a treatment protocol for each treatment
            group was developed and a treatment diary will be filled out after each session. Interventions
            in the derivation and validation phase are similar.

               Such therapy involves very specific low-load exercises of deeper trunk muscles that
               are dysfunctional in nonspecific CLBP

            <p>Patients in this intervention group follow motor control training based on the work
               by Richardson and Hides 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">33</span>
               </span>. There are three levels to be completed by the patients. To evolve to the next level
               the patient must be able to correctly execute each exercise described in the former
               level. However, if the patient is not able to do so in the first level within three
               weeks of treatment or after six sessions, we will automatically proceed to the second
               level with the intention to minimalize the drop out and maximize the patient’s compliance.
               The first level is based on the isolated contraction of the local motor control muscles.
               Contraction of the transversus abdominis is performed with low intensity controlled
               by palpation. The second level is based on the contraction of local and global motor
               control and global mobilizing muscles. In the third level patients will practice the
               contraction of local and global motor control and global mobilizing muscles in functional
               patient specific conditions (for example a patient who has to perform a lot of loaded
               trunk rotations during work will get specific exercises in a rotation movement direction,
               similar to the work condition) (Tables 
               <span tagx="tblr">4</span> and

               followed. It contains progressive resistance isometric training of lumbar trunk muscles
               on devices in the directions flexion, extension, rotation and lateral flexion. In
               the first session, the maximal isometric strength is determined in all movement directions
               to set the level of resistance for training. During the first to fourth week, patients
               train at 30%, and during the fifth till ninth week, at 40% of their maximal isometric
               strength. When the difference in maximal isometric power for rotation or lateral flexion
               direction between abdominal and back muscles exceeds 20%, the weaker side has to perform
               five sets and the stronger side has to perform four sets (Tables

               hypothesis is used to calculate the power. In the validation phase we need 105 patients
               to detect a minimum clinically important difference (effect size 0.43) with 80% power
               using a one-tailed hypothesis. This means that three groups of 35 patients are needed

            <p>Potential predictive variables are selected as follows: first, individual variables

               association with the reference standard using independent sample t tests, Mann-Whitney

               level of 
               <i>P</i> &lt;0.10 are retained as potential prediction variables. We chose a more liberal significance
               level at this stage to avoid excluding potential predictive variables.

               develop a multiple CPR for classifying patients as likely responders to treatment.
               This statistical analysis is performed for each treatment group (motor control therapy,

               nine weeks, six months and one year) as the within-subject variable. The dependent
               variable is disability (MODI score). The hypothesis of interest is the three-way interaction,
               and the two-way interactions between time and treatment group and between time and
               classification subgroup. We hypothesize that outcome over time will not differ based
               on the randomized treatment group, or the classification subgroup, but will depend
               on the interaction between the treatment group and classification subgroup, such that
               patients randomized to matched treatment will have better outcomes than patients randomized
               to unmatched treatment. This hypothesis will be supported if the three-way interaction
               is significant, but the two-way interactions are not. Pairwise 
               <i>post-hoc</i> comparisons will be performed at each follow-up period to further explore any significant
               interaction terms. In both the derivation and validation phase we will use an intention-to-treat
               analysis.

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The goal of this trial is the derivation and validation of a CPR for the choice of
         an exercise therapy type in nonspecific CLBP patients. Our study protocol differs
         from previous studies on several points.
      </p>
      <p>First, a randomized clinical trial with several treatment options is used. So far,
         only one CPR for motor control therapy is derived in patients with non-radicular LBP
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span>. A single-arm intervention study design was used. The derivation of a CPR for exercise
         therapy should be repeated in a randomized controlled trial design to confirm and
         reinforce findings. If a randomized controlled trial design is used, differences between
         different intervention groups can be made, and patients are randomly allocated into
         these groups to ensure there is no difference between the groups for success outcome.
      </p>
      <p>Second, we target CLBP patients with a sufficiently long history of LBP. Hicks 
         <i>et al</i>.’s 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span> study sample had a mean duration of current symptoms for 40.6 days. Patients with
         symptoms for 40.6 days are classified as having sub-acute LBP 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. Brennan 
         <i>et al</i>.’s 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
         </span> study sample had a mean duration of current symptoms for 16 days, which are acute
         and sub-acute LBP problems 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. In contrast, we aim to include patients with persisting LBP for at least three months
         to ensure we only target genuine CLBP patients 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. We target CLBP patients because these patients are a big challenge for adequate
         treatment and they bring high health-related costs to society. Since both studies
         describe an acute and sub-acute study sample, our study results might differ from
         theirs 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
         </span>. In conclusion we state that derivation, validation and impact phase of the development
         of a CPR for exercise therapy in a chronic LBP study sample has not yet been described
         in the literature.
      </p>
      <p>Third, we aim to include a sufficiently large sample, based on a power analysis. Hicks
         
         <i>et al</i>. 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span> included 54 patients in their study but no power analysis is mentioned in their paper.
         If there are not enough patients included, the CPR is unlikely to be valid. We compared
         our calculated sample size with the sample size calculated in Brennan 
         <i>et al</i>.’s 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
         </span> study design and found comparable results. In addition, we use an extra 54% inclusion
         target to compensate for the possible dropout rate 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">34</span>
         </span>. We aim to recruit 489 patients in total (combined total for both phases of the study).
         We calculated that each year around 200 LBP patients start the back revalidation program
         in the Antwerp University Hospital. This is the same for the Apra Rehabilitation Hospital.
         Out of these 400 LBP patients around 50% have nonspecific complaints. This means that
         we need around 18 months to finish each phase. We will closely follow the inclusion
         procedure to make sure we meet our goals. The current study protocol describes only
         the derivation and validation phase, and not the impact phase. Future research should
         target this impact phase. The impact phase needs a completely different approach since
         it investigates the economic consequences of the implication of the CPR. It also depends
         on the outcome of the derivation and validation phase. Consequently, it is beyond
         the scope of the present paper.
