                  <h3>Background</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Acute gastroenteritis is a major cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality, accounting
                  for 15% of all childhood deaths worldwide. In developing countries, diarrheal diseases
                  continue to be a major public health burden. Evidence from developed countries suggests
                  that intake of lactose-free milk during diarrheal episodes may reduce the duration
                  of the illness in pediatric inpatients. It is unknown whether lactose-free milk reduces
                  the severity or duration of acute gastroenteritis in infants treated in outpatient
                  settings in developing countries where diarrhea is more severe, and results in higher
                  morbidities and mortalities. We hypothesize that lactose-free milk intake during acute
                  gastroenteritis would significantly decrease the duration and severity of diarrhea
                  in infants presenting to the Emergency Department (ED), as compared with lactose-containing
                  milk.

                  continue on regular infant formula for a total of 7 days. Infants will be followed
                  up for 7 days. Outcome measures: Diarrhea duration, weight loss, illness clinic visits,
                  hospitalization rate, parental satisfaction, and time to symptom resolution. Statistical
                  analysis: Descriptive and regression analysis will be conducted under the intention-to-treat

               </div>
               <p>Acute gastroenteritis is a public health burden for developing countries, with a significant
                  impact on infant morbidity and mortality. Provision of infant formula that may reduce
                  the duration and severity of diarrhea can decrease this burden in countries with limited
                  healthcare resources, like Lebanon. The findings from this study are anticipated to
                  provide evidence-based dietary recommendations for ambulatory infants with acute diarrhea
                  in developing countries.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Acute diarrheal illness is a major public health burden worldwide, and more so in
         developing countries. Diarrhea is the second cause of morbidity and mortality in children
         younger than 5 years, accounting for around 15% of all childhood death, and leading
         to more than 1 million deaths each year 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition
         estimates the overall yearly incidence of diarrhea in children younger than 3 years
         at 1.3 episodes per child 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. The mean incidence rate in developing countries is almost double that reported from
         industrialized countries and amounts to an average of three episodes per child per
         year 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>. Diarrheal diseases are also a financial burden at the macro- (country) and micro-
         (family) levels. In the United States, diarrhea leads to 2.1 to 3.7 physician visits
         per child each year, with an average cost of $289 per episode 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>. Moreover, pediatric diarrhea is known to afflict parental well-being, causing major
         emotional distress and fatigue.
      </p>
      <p>Pediatric diarrhea can last for several days, leading to dehydration, electrolyte
         disturbances, and malnutrition, especially in children younger than5 years. Children
         who are malnourished, or have impaired immunity are at higher risk of life-threatening
         complications from diarrhea. The main etiology of acute diarrheal disease in children
         younger than 5 years is intestinal tract infection caused by a variety of viral, bacterial,
         or parasitic organisms. Acute infectious diarrhea may cause damage to the lactase-containing
         epithelial cells present on the tips of the intestinal villi, thus causing lactose
         malabsorption. The new epithelial cells that replace older ones are usually immature
         and often lack sufficient lactase activity, which will further exacerbate the lactose
         malabsorption, with subsequent prolongation of the diarrheal episode.
      </p>
      <p>Adequate nutrition and hydration during diarrheal episodes is necessary to avoid dehydration,
         malnutrition, and weight loss. In a systematic review published in 1994, Brown et
         al. 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span> reported clinical improvement after the use of lactose-free milk products in young
         children with severe dehydration. A recent Cochrane review reported the results of
         33 randomized or quasi-randomized trials that assessed the effects of reducing or
         avoiding lactose in young children (&lt;5 years) with diarrhea on the duration and/or
         severity of the illness 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>. The review concluded that lactose-free products may reduce the duration of the diarrhea
         by an average of 18 hours (MD, −17.77; 95% CI, −25.32 to −10.21, low-quality evidence)
         as compared with lactose-containing formula. Also, lactose-free products may reduce
         treatment failure, such as continued diarrhea or vomiting, continuing weight loss
         or need for additional rehydration treatment by around a half (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.39
         to 0.68, moderate quality evidence). However, all trials were conducted in high- or
         middle-income countries, and most of them included inpatients only. Hence, a need
         exists for high-quality trials to be conducted in developing countries where the incidence,
         severity, and consequences of diarrhea are high, including mortality and malnutrition.
      </p>
      <p>In this study, we aim to investigate the effect of lactose-free milk on the duration
         and severity of diarrhea in infants with acute gastroenteritis in the ambulatory setting
         (Emergency Department). We anticipate that the findings of this study will add to
         the evidence base of dietary recommendations for infants with acute diarrhea in developing
         countries who are treated in ambulatory care.

               milk formula, and who present to the ED of the American University of Beirut Medical
               Center with acute gastroenteritis. Diarrhea is defined as the passage of three or
               more loose or liquid stools in 24 hours, for at least 24 hours, and not exceeding
               2 weeks from presentation, with or without fever, vomiting, mucus, or blood per stools.
            </p>
            <p>Infants with any of the following conditions will be excluded: any breastfeeding,
               sepsis, chronic diarrhea, severe dehydration, inflammatory bowel disease, cow’s milk
               allergy, necrotizing enterocolitis, intussusception, volvulus, current intake of lactose-free

               and control, 1:1 ratio), by using a computer-generated stratified block randomization.
               Stratification will be done by age groups: &lt;6 months versus ≥6 months, with block
               sizes varying between 4 and 8. The random sequence will be generated by an independent
               biostatistician. Allocation concealment will be done to ensure that group assignments
               of the participants are revealed only after assessing that the inclusion/exclusion
               criteria are verified and consent obtained. This will avoid any bias that might be
               introduced by the investigator because of the knowledge of the allocation of the next
               subject. A set of sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes will be prepared with

            two groups with 90% power and 5% type I error, 12 infants will be needed in each arm
            (24 infants in total). We anticipate that 30% to 40% of infants that will be recruited
            will either withdraw or will be lost to follow-up from previous research experience.
            Hence, to allow for a loss-to-follow up rate of 35%, we will inflate the sample size
            to become 40 infants.

            <h3>Statistical methods</h3>
         </div>
         <p>We will compare continuous variables (duration of diarrhea, percentage weight loss,
            age) by using the Student 
            <i>t</i> test, and categoric variables (proportions, categories of severity) by using a χ
            <sup>2</sup> test. Nonparametric tests will be used to analyze variables with skewed distribution
            or when the number of analyzed subjects is fewer than 30. Baseline characteristics
            of both groups will be compared to assure similarity of groups at study entry, and
            to identify clinically significant imbalance of any variable that needs adjustment
            during analysis. Risk ratios will be calculated for the outcomes of hospital admission
            and return physician visit. Results will be reported as means or medians when appropriate,
            intervals will be calculated. To assess the severity of diarrhea, we will evaluate
            the stool quantity and quality from the parental responses to the questions in the
            diary. For the quantity evaluation, we will consider passage of three to four stools
            per day as consistent with mild diarrhea, five to seven stools per day as consistent
            with moderate diarrhea, and eight or more stools per day as consistent with severe
            diarrhea.
         </p>
         <p>For the quality evaluation, the responses will be assigned points ranging from a minimum
            of zero to a maximum of 6. A cumulative score will be created for the stool-quality
            assessment, which is the sum of points to all responses, ranging from zero to 14.
            We will consider that an overall qualitative score of 0 to 4 is consistent with mild
            diarrhea, 5 to 8 as consistent with moderate diarrhea, and a score of ≥9 as consistent
            with severe diarrhea. The main analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat principle.
            In addition, we will conduct per-protocol analyses for primary and secondary outcomes.
            The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21 will be used for data
            management and analyses. A 
            <i>P</i> value of &lt;0.05 will indicate statistical significance.

            Written informed consent will be obtained from the parents. Because the study involves
            comparison of two types of milk formula, we estimate that the risks to infants from

            practice. Confidentiality of participants will be secured by storing data sheets in

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>This study aims at investigating whether lactose-free milk, when compared with lactose-containing
         milk, will shorten the duration and lessen the severity of diarrhea in infants with
         gastroenteritis who are treated in the ambulatory setting (ED) of a hospital in a
         developing country. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 1.5 million
         children under the age of 5 years die each year of diarrhea; half of those are from
         the developing world 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>. Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life is one cost-effective intervention
         that reduces the risk of infant death of diarrhea. Unfortunately, fewer than 40% of
         infants younger than6 months in developing countries are exclusively breastfed 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>. The lack of studies from the developing world investigating the effectiveness of
         lactose-free milk in reducing the duration or severity of infant diarrhea underscores
         the need for high-quality trials that can address this knowledge gap. Hence, this
         study may provide much-needed evidence regarding the dietary recommendations of formula-fed
         infants with acute gastroenteritis.
      </p>
      <p>The study may have some limitations. The first limitation is the sampling frame, which
         is the ED of one hospital in an urban setting, from which a convenience sample of
         infants is recruited. It can be argued that infants living in rural areas may have
         a much more severe illness and may respond differently to the lactose-free milk. However,
         AUBMC is a major referral center for all the country, with patients seen in its ED
         from different urban and rural areas.
      </p>
      <p>Another limitation is the small sample size. This is because the standard error used
         to calculate the sample size is relatively large (16 hours) in comparison with the
         estimated effect size (24 hours). Nevertheless, the effect size and its standard error
         were those reported by the most recent Cochrane Review about the subject.
      </p>
      <p>The third limitation is the open-label design, which is due to the difficulty in concealing
         the milk containers in our setting, and to the fact that it is very likely that parents
         will decline participation in a trial in which they cannot know the name of the milk
         brand their infant will take. Despite these limitations, we anticipate that lactose-free
         milk, if proven effective, will have a significant impact on the morbidity of formula-fed
         infants with acute gastroenteritis in developing countries.
