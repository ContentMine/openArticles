               </div>
               <p>Autologous arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) are the optimal form of vascular access for
                  haemodialysis. AVFs typically require 6 to 8 weeks to “mature” from the time of surgery
                  before they can be cannulated. Patients with end-stage renal disease needing urgent
                  vascular access therefore traditionally require insertion of a tunnelled central venous
                  catheter (TCVC). TCVCs are associated with high infection rates and central venous
                  stenosis.
               </p>
               <p>Early cannulation synthetic arteriovenous grafts (ecAVG) provide a novel alternative
                  to TCVCs, permitting rapid access to the bloodstream and immediate needling for haemodialysis.
                  Published rates of infection in small series are low.
               </p>
               <p>The aim of this study is to compare whether TCVC ± AVF or ecAVG ± AVF provide a better
                  strategy for managing patients requiring immediate vascular access for haemodialysis.

               <p>This is a prospective randomised controlled trial comparing the strategy of TCVC ± AVF
                  to ecAVG ± AVF. Patients requiring urgent vascular access will receive a study information
                  sheet and written consent will be obtained. Patients will be randomised to receive
                  either: (i) TCVC (and native AVF if this is anatomically possible) or (ii) ecAVG (±
                  AVF).
               </p>
               <p>118 patients will be recruited. The primary outcome is systemic bacteraemia at 6 months.
                  Secondary outcomes include culture-proven bacteraemia rates at 1 year and 2 years;
                  primary and secondary patency rates at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months; stenoses; re-intervention
                  rates; re-admission rate; mortality and quality of life. Additionally, treatment delays,
                  impact on service provision and cost-effectiveness will be evaluated.

               </div>
               <p>This is the first randomised controlled trial comparing TCVC to ecAVG for patients
                  requiring urgent vascular access for haemodialysis. The complications of TCVC are
                  considered an unfortunate necessity in patients requiring urgent haemodialysis who
                  do not have autologous vascular access. If this study demonstrates that ecAVGs provide
                  a safe and practical alternative to TCVC, this could instigate a paradigm shift in
                  nephrology thinking and access planning.

      </div>
      <p>Vascular access dysfunction is the leading cause of morbidity amongst patients with
         end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is a key performance indicator for haemodialysis
         service provision 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. Complications of vascular access are responsible for over 20% of all hospitalisations
         in patients on haemodialysis and account for one-third of all inpatient renal bed
         use 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Autologous arteriovenous fistulae (AVFs) are the vascular access modality of choice
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span> with fewer infective and thrombotic complications than the alternatives 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>: tunnelled central venous catheters (TCVCs) and prosthetic arteriovenous grafts (AVGs).
         The major limitations to native AVF usage are a 6 to 8 week “maturation” lag from
         creation to first cannulation and 30 to 50% early failure rate 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>. Unfortunately, due to a combination of late referral, primary access failure and
         acute presentation of renal failure, 40 to 50% of incident patients do not have a
         functioning AVF when they commence dialysis 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>. Given the unpredictable progression of decline in renal function to ESRD 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span> and the fact that 30 to 35% of patients needing to start haemodialysis are “crashlanders”
         (known to the renal services for &lt;90 days) 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>, whilst desirable, it is not always practicably possible to achieve autologous vascular
         access for all patients prior to commencing haemodialysis. Current practice necessitates
         TCVC for these patients until definitive vascular access can be secured. Patients
         who began haemodialysis via a TCVC are more likely to remain with TCVC 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span>; therefore, optimizing incident vascular access is vitally important.
      </p>
      <p>TCVCs are associated with a significantly higher risk of infection, mortality, mechanical
         complications and other chronic problems such as immunosuppression, malnutrition and
         central venous stenosis than other forms of vascular access 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span>. A recent Scottish study of 2,666 patients revealed a two- to threefold increased
         risk in mortality (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular or infection-related mortality)
         and a sevenfold increase in death from septicaemia with the use of TCVCs 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span>. For these reasons, TCVC are considered an option of last resort.
      </p>
      <p>AVGs provide an intermediate option between AVF and TCVCs, permitting earlier cannulation
         than AVF but lower bacteraemia rates than TCVC (0.6 per 1,000 dialysis days) 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span>. The longevity and patency of AVGs are variable and almost certainly poorer than
         native AVF with 1-year primary patency rates ranging from 40 to 60% 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span>. However, with aggressive re-intervention for the management of thrombosis, secondary
         patency rates of as high as 90% at 1 year can be achieved 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">15</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Traditional AVGs still require a delay of approximately 2 weeks from implantation
         to initial cannulation, compelling TCVC insertion as a stop-gap measure in the majority
         of cases. However, early cannulation arteriovenous grafts (ecAVGs), which permit immediate
         needling, may provide a novel alternative permitting TCVC avoidance in many cases
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span>. The GORE
         <b>®</b> Acuseal™ (W.L.Gore Associates Ltd., Flagstaff, Arizona) vascular access graft is
         one such ecAVG. It is a tri-layer graft with unique sealing properties to permit safe
         cannulation within 24 hours of insertion. The tri-layer construction comprises an
         inner layer of heparinised expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, an outer layer of standard
         expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft, and a central elastomeric layer 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
         </span>. This central layer gives the graft its unique “low bleed” properties and permits
         early cannulation, reducing the time to achieve haemostasis significantly compared
         to standard expanded polytetrafluoroethylene.
      </p>
      <p>These unique properties of Acuseal™ and other ecAVGs make them an attractive alternative
         to TCVCs in patients requiring urgent vascular access for haemodialysis with theoretical
         benefits of reduced infection and avoidance of long-term TCVC complications such as
         central venous stenosis. In small series, the Acuseal™ graft has been shown to be
         beneficial in patients requiring urgent access for haemodialysis as a “bridge” to
         AVF maturation or transplantation, as well as in patients with pre-existing occlusion
         of their central veins 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
         </span>. A recent observational study conducted in our unit has indicated that ecAVG provide
         a practical, feasible and acceptable alternative to TCVCs in patients requiring urgent
         vascular access for haemodialysis 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
         </span>. Furthermore, cost-analysis has shown that the additional initial outlay costs of
         consumables can be offset against reduced septic complications, hospital admissions
         and bed days, with potential cost savings of nearly £1,000 at 6 months with ecAVG
         compared to TCVCs 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>We now intend to test this hypothesis in a randomised controlled trial comparing TCVCs
         (± AVF) to ecAVG (±AVF).

            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The use of ecAVGs ± AVFs will reduce the rate of culture-proven bacteraemia at 6 months
            compared to the use of TCVCs ± AVFs in patients with ESRD requiring urgent vascular
            access for haemodialysis.

            <h3>Objectives and outcome measures</h3>
         </div>
         <p>This study aims for a strategy of comparing ecAVG ± autologous AVF (if anatomically
            suitable) to TCVC ± autologous AVF in patients requiring urgent vascular access for
            haemodialysis. The primary outcome measure is culture-proven bacteraemia at 6 months.
            Secondary outcomes include culture-proven bacteraemia at 12 and 24 months; primary,
            secondary and functional patency rates at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months; stenosis, thrombosis
            and re-intervention rates (including the need for urokinase infusions, AVG declotting
            procedures and TCVC replacement); other complications, including local infection,
            suspected access-related infection, steal syndrome, cardiovascular compromise, central
            venous stenosis; mortality at 6, 12 and 24 months, quality of life (assessed by EQ-5D)
            at 6 months; future sites of vascular access; re-admission rates and bed day utilisation
            and efficiency and efficacy of dialysis (urea reduction ratio, access flows, and recirculation).
            Additionally delays to treatment and the impact on service provision (access to theatre,
            and so forth) will be assessed to evaluate the practicalities of each treatment regimen.
            Cost-utility analysis will also be performed. Definitions of patency and other access-related
            complications will be as described by Sidawy and colleagues

         </div>
         <p>All patients will be admitted under the care of the Nephrology Team at the Western
            Infirmary. Patients requiring urgent vascular access for haemodialysis will be assessed
            by their clinical team. Temporary venous catheter will be inserted to permit life-saving
            haemodialysis if required. The clinical team will then refer the patient to the Vascular
            Access Co-ordinator for TCVC insertion and definitive vascular access creation.

         <p>All patients referred for TCVC insertion will be assessed by a member of the research
            team within 6 hours of referral. All adult patients (≥18 years old) with ESRD requiring
            urgent vascular access for haemodialysis will be eligible to participate. Patients
            will be excluded if they have significant cardiorespiratory co-morbidities or peripheral
            vascular disease precluding anaesthesia or ecAVG creation, a brachial artery &lt;2 mm
            diameter on duplex ultrasound, significant and untreated systemic sepsis with positive

         <p>All patients will undergo Duplex ultrasound of both arms. Both the venous and arterial
            tree will be assessed and a pre-operative plan made to site both ecAVG and native
            AVF. Wherever possible, care will be taken to preserve all sites for future autologous
            access and the site of native AVF will always be favoured in the non-dominant arm
            and distally first. ecAVG will be placed to accommodate optimal AVF placement. For
            example, a native left radiocephalic fistula and right forearm loop or right brachioaxillary
            graft would be favoured in a left-handed patient with good native vessels and no previous
            vascular access; whilst revision of an existing occluded left brachiocephalic fistula
            with outflow stenosis using an interposition ecAVG and contralateral elbow AVF would
            be considered in an elderly patient with poor vessels and occluded existing AVF.

               will be inserted with 280- or 320-mm catheters used for right- and left-sided cannulation,
               respectively. Catheters will be inserted via a Seldinger technique under image guidance.
               A standard catheter care protocol will be employed throughout the study period. This
               demands complete sterile precautions during catheter insertion and upon manipulation
               of the hub. Following catheter hub manipulation, the skin surrounding the insertion
               site is soaked with chlorhexidine solution prior to a sterile dressing being applied.
               An interdialytic lock with heparin 5,000 iU/ml to the internal volume of the catheter
               will be employed.

            <p>First haemodialysis via the TCVC will be performed by trained nursing staff within

            <p>Patients randomised to the ecAVG ± AVF arm of the study will be immediately assessed
               by a member of the anaesthetic team. An operative slot will be found within either
               emergency or elective theatres at the Western Infirmary for ecAVG creation within
               24 hours.

            <p>All patients will be treated with pre-operative prophylactic vancomycin 1 g intravenously
               (or teicoplanin if the patient is vancomycin allergic). ecAVG insertion will be performed
               by a single operating surgeon either under supraclavicular block or general anaesthetic.
            </p>
            <p>The patient’s skin will be prepared with alcoholic betadine, draped in a standard
               fashion and an Ioban™ skin covering (3 M Healthcare, Bracknell, UK) applied to maintain
               strict asepsis. The vessels will be exposed and controlled in a standard fashion.
               The Acuseal™ graft will then be tunnelled in the subcutaneous fat using standard tunnelling
               tools. A 4-cm longitudinal venotomy will be performed and the graft spatulated at
               the venous end in an attempt to minimize venous stenosis. The arteriotomy will be
               a standard size to accommodate the graft. Arterial and venous anastomoses will be
               performed using continuous 5.0 Prolene. Collatamp™ (Tribute Pharmaceuticals, Milton,
               Ontario, Canada) will be inserted into the wounds prior to closure to minimize the
               risk of infection. Drains will be placed at the surgeon’s discretion.
            </p>
            <p>Post-operatively the patient will be managed within the Inpatient Renal Unit of the
               Western Infirmary. First cannulation of the ecAVG will be performed by our trained
               dialysis nursing staff in agreement between the Nephrology and Surgical Teams as the
               patient’s clinical condition dictates. This may be as soon as 30 minutes post-operatively.
            </p>
            <p>Sharp needles (17 G), low flows (200 to 250 ml/min) and minimal heparin will be used
               for first cannulation of ecAVGs. Full aseptic technique will be used for cannulation
               and direct pressure applied at the needle sites for at least 10 minutes after the
               needles have been removed. These same techniques will be used for the first 2 weeks
               of cannulation. Thereafter, higher flow rates may be used if necessary to achieve
               adequate dialysis clearance. Success and complications of dialysis sessions and cannulation
               will be recorded. At least two successful cannulations of the ecAVG will be performed
               prior to discharge to the Outpatient Dialysis Unit. All patients will continue on
               intravenous vancomycin for a week post-operatively. Heparin, warfarin and anti-platelet
               agents will be administered at the discretion of the operating surgeon. All patients
               who re-present with thrombotic complications will be anti-coagulated with warfarin
               (international normalised ratio 2–3) unless contraindicated.
            </p>
            <p>Should the patient develop any problems with their ecAVG upon discharge they will
               be reviewed immediately by a member of the Renal Surgical Team at the Western Infirmary
               as is standard practice. In the event of thrombosis of ecAVG, aggressive attempts
               will be made by both the surgical and radiological teams to salvage the dialysis access
               as is standard practice. All complications will be recorded within the patient’s electronic

            <p>Patients in both treatment arms will also undergo creation of an autologous AVF (if
               this is anatomically possible) at the first available opportunity. The ecAVG/TCVC
               will continue to be utilized for haemodialysis until the AVF is mature enough to cannulate.
               The decision to undertake first cannulation of the AVF will be taken by the clinical
               team (normally ~6 weeks after creation) and recorded within the patient’s electronic
               patient record.
            </p>
            <p>Once the patient is successfully dialyzing via their AVF, the fate of an ecAVG, which
               is no longer required, will be decided after discussion between the patient and surgical
               team. In the majority of cases it will be left 
               <i>in situ</i> but can be removed or ligated if required/wished. TCVCs will be removed by the surgical
               team after six successful AVF cannulations as is standard practice.

               <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
            </span>. In order to calculate sample size, we made the following assumptions: type 1 error
            (α) was set at 0.05 and type 2 error (β) at 0.8. Therefore, if we assume a systemic
            bacteraemia rate in the TCVC arm of 24% at 6 months and propose a bacteraemia rate
            of 5% at 6 months in the ecAVG arm, then 53 patients are required in each group. In
            order to account for attrition of around 10%, we aim to recruit 118 patients. This
            magnitude of difference between the two treatment arms is considered to be clinically
            significant and realistic given the published rates of systemic bacteraemia for ecAVG
            in our institution

         </p>
         <p>The null hypothesis for this study is that there is no difference between systemic
            bacteraemia rates at 6 months in patients who require urgent vascular access for haemodialysis
            treated with TCVC ± AVF and those treated with ecAVG ± AVF.

         <p>Descriptive statistics will be used to describe continuous variables. Results for
            continuous variables will be reported as mean (± standard deviation) or median (interquartile
            range). Assuming normal distribution, treatment groups will be compared using a student’s
            t-test or, if data are found to not be normally distributed, a Mann–Whitney U-test
            will be used. Analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Additionally,
            a cost-consequence analysis will be conducted, comparing the costs (for example, treatment,
            procedures, hospital stay, and so forth) and the consequences (for example, health
            outcomes such as bacteraemia episodes, mortality, and so forth) of both treatment

            <h3>Limitations and potential solutions</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Traditionally, recruitment in trials relating to vascular access can be difficult.
            In one recent large study, over 2,000 patients were screened to recruit just 225 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">25</span>
            </span>. This study had very strict inclusion criteria, which can be difficult to achieve
            in a heterogeneous patient population such as ESRD. It is not anticipated that such
            problems will be encountered in our study for several reasons: firstly, this will
            be an inclusive study (rather than having strict inclusion/exclusion criteria); secondly,
            a local pilot study 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
            </span> has demonstrated that 79 patients had TCVCs inserted over a 6-month period and therefore
            might be approached for inclusion in this study.
         </p>
         <p>The power calculation for this study is based on a bacteraemia rate of 24% in the
            TCVC arm. This rate is higher than that described in many series, but is derived directly
            from our local pilot study 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
            </span>. It may be that these higher rates of infection relate to early post-insertion infection
            rates, rather than overall bacteraemia rates for static prevalent TCVCs.

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The purpose of this trial is to investigate the hypothesis that, in patients requiring
         urgent vascular access for haemodialysis, the 6-month culture-proven bacteraemia rate
         is improved by a strategy of ecAVG ± AVF compared to TCVC ± AVF as this has not yet
         been demonstrated in a large randomised controlled trial.
      </p>
      <p>Complications of vascular access are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
         patients with ESRD. The healthcare costs from a catheter-related bacteraemia range
         from $6,000 to $29,000 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">26</span>
         </span>. If the proposed strategy of ecAVG ± AVF is found to reduce culture-proven bacteraemia
         rates, it could result in significant reduction in healthcare costs and reduced morbidity
         and hospitalisation for patients with ESRD. This could lead to a paradigm shift away
         from TCVC in patients requiring urgent vascular access. Conversely if TCVC ± AVF is
         found to be superior, this finding would support our current strategy of TCVC usage
         in this patient cohort. Therefore, either a positive or negative result will help
         inform future practice regarding the optimal strategy of vascular access in patients
         requiring urgent haemodialysis.
