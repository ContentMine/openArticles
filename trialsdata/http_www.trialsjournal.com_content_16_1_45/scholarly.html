               </div>
               <p>Previous research has shown that electroacupuncture therapy has a potential therapeutic
                  effect for simple female stress urinary incontinence. In this study, pelvic floor
                  muscle training, the first-line treatment for stress urinary incontinence in women
                  based on meta-analysis of numerous randomized control trials and recommended by international
                  clinical practice, is used as a control group to demonstrate whether electroacupuncture
                  therapy is a better method for female stress urinary incontinence.

               </div>
               <p>A randomized controlled trial has been designed to evaluate the therapeutic benefit
                  of electroacupuncture for female stress urinary incontinence compared with pelvic
                  floor muscle training. The safety of electroacupuncture and patient compliance will
                  also be evaluated. Untoward reaction to the electroacupuncture, including a broken
                  needle, fainting on acupuncture, or pain during acupuncture, will be recorded and
                  the therapy will be stopped if an untoward reaction occurs. After we have received
                  full ethical approval and patient consent, participants will be randomized to receive
                  a series of 24 electroacupuncture or pelvic floor muscle training interventions. The
                  frequency and amount of leakage will be measured as the primary outcome parameters.
                  Secondary outcome parameters include the 1-hour pad test, the short-form of the International
                  Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire, patient subjective effectiveness evaluation,
                  weekly usage of pad, and usage of specialty therapy for female stress urinary incontinence.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>According to the International Continence Society, stress urinary incontinence (SUI)
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span> is defined as involuntary loss of urine during coughing or sneezing 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. Female SUI (FSUI) is a common condition which affects quality of life in women aged
         40 to 75 years 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>

         </div>
         <div tagx="graphic"></div>
      </div>
      <p>In China, the prevalence of urinary incontinence in women is 46.5%, of which SUI makes
         up 59.6% 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>. Any women of old age are at high risk of SUI 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>. Women with SUI are embarrassed to take part in social activities, and as a result
         their lifestyles are altered putting them at increased risk of lifestyle-related disease,
         such as osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary disease, mammary cancer,
         carcinoma of colon, depression, anxiety, and so forth 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>The International Consultation on Urological Diseases recommend that treatment methods
         for mild and moderate SUI are lifestyle intervention, behavior therapy, pelvic floor
         muscle (PFM) training, functional electroacupuncture, and so forth 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>. PFM training has level A evidence of efficacy, with a curative rate ranging from
         30 to 60% 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>. However, training duration should be at least 2 months. In China, PFM training is
         not as efficient as expected because there are not enough physical therapists, and
         patient compliance to treatment needs to be improved 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>. Primary therapy for moderate and severe SUI is surgery, which carries a high potential
         for adverse events. A safety communication from the US Food and Drug Administration
         on serious complications associated with transvaginal placement of a surgical mesh
         for pelvic organ prolapse was issued on 13 July 2011 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>. Therefore, there is a need to explore other treatment avenues.
      </p>
      <p>By contrast, acupuncture for FSUI works over a short period with a high curative rate
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span>, which shows potential advantages for FSUI. In a previous study 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span>, electroacupunture was verified as a more effective therapy for SUI than acupuncture,
         possibly related to the PFM and nerves. However, the level of evidence was rated as
         “low” 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>A trial of high methodological quality is needed to determine whether electroacupuncture
         is effective for FSUI. This trial will evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture and
         investigate whether electroacupuncture is a better treatment for FSUI than PFM training.

               alternate days for 30 minutes per session, giving 24 treatments in total. The procedure
               is as follows. Electroacupuncture on the points Bilateral Zhong Liao (BL33) and Hui
               Yang (BL35) (Additional file 
               <div tagx="supplr">1</div>) for 50 to 60 mm (using a 75-mm filiform needle). The needle will be inserted inward
               and downward at an angle of 30 to 45°. After insertion, the needle will be twirled,
               lifted and thrust three times until the patient has a needling sensation If the needle
               breaks during treatment it will be removed and the quality of the other needles will
               be checked. If a patient faints, the treatment will be suspended until they recover.
               If a patient feels pain, we will change the needle insertion angle and depth. The
               electric stimulator is applied to bilateral BL33 and BL35 with a continuous wave,
               50 Hz electric current at 1 to 5 mA from the positive pole to the negative pole. The
               treatment design is based on literature research over the preceding 10 years, former

               <div tagx="supplr">2</div>). Before performing PFM training, patients should learn the position of the PFM.
               The PFM is the muscle we contract to stop passing water when urinating. Alternatively,
               vaginal palpation can be used to identify the specific position of the PFM. The patient
               can insert their finger into the vagina to feel the muscle contraction if convenient.
               PFM training is performed by standing/sitting/lying on the back with knees bent. Continuously
               contract the PFM three times, until the patient feels they cannot contract any more
               strongly; then hold on the contraction, and breathe twice (inhale, exhale, inhale,
               exhale); then relax the whole body, breathing another two times (inhale, exhale, inhale,
               exhale). Then contract PFM again. Repeat the above procedure for 15 minutes

               mean degree of leakage is compared with the baseline mean degree measured at week
               0. The degree can be divided into four levels: mild degree (a very small amount of
               leakage with several drops); moderate degree (moderate leakage which wets the women’s
               underwear, but does not wet the over-trousers); and severe degree (a large amount

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The results of this trial are expected to provide convincing evidence whether acupuncture
         is a more effective method for patients with SUI than PFM training. The trial is sponsored
         and financially supported by “the Twelfth Five-year Plan” from the Ministry of Science
         and Technology of China, which is the most important basic research program based
         on clinical practice.
      </p>
      <p>The proposed study presents the first high quality randomized controlled trial on
         electroacupuncture for FSUI. As identified in a recently published review and a systematic
         review and meta analysis (Wang Y, Zhishun L, Peng W, Zhao J, Liu B, manuscript accepted),
         only a few studies have investigated electroacupuncture for FSUI 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
         </span>. None of these was adequately powered to allow valid conclusions on its optimal effectiveness.
         Additional risk of bias was introduced by methodological issues, such as invalid randomization
         procedures and unclear blinding, leading to a grading of the current level of evidence
         as “low” 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>. Therefore, we are conducting a multicenter, randomized, controlled large-scale trial
         to clarify whether electroacupuncture is more effective than PFM training in treating
         SUI.
      </p>
      <p>There are two different treatment groups in this trial: the electroacupuncture group
         and the PFM training group. Bilateral Zhong Liao and Hui Yang are applied in the electroacupuncture
         group, which are regarded as the most common acupuncture prescriptions. The electric
         stimulator is applied to bilateral BL33 and BL35 with a continuous wave, 50 Hz, 1
         to 5 mA electric current, which is expected to be the best therapeutic effect. PFM
         training has received Level A evidence rating in the treatment of SUI in women, based
         on meta-analyses of numerous randomized control trials, and is recommended in many
         published guidelines 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
         </span>. Thus, PFM training is used as the control group.
      </p>
      <p>In this trial, we use a 1:1 randomization design comparing electroacupuncture to PFM
         training to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture, and investigate whether electroacupuncture
         is a better treatment for SUI in comparison to PFM training. The sample size estimation
         ensures adequate power (90%) to allow valid conclusions. With the high prevalence
         of SUI and the socioeconomic burden of SUI, there is a demand for effective, safe,
         non-invasive and low-cost treatment options for this specific patient group. The primary
         outcome measures are based on authoritative literatures on comparable study interventions
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>In conclusion, the results of this trial are expected to confirm the effectiveness
         of electroacupuncture and whether it is a better treatment for SUI compared with PFM
         training.
