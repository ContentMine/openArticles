                <p>Previous research has shown that electroacupuncture therapy has a potential therapeutic effect for simple female stress urinary incontinence. In this study, pelvic floor muscle training, the first-line treatment for stress urinary incontinence in women based on meta-analysis of numerous randomized control trials and recommended by international clinical practice, is used as a control group to demonstrate whether electroacupuncture therapy is a better method for female stress urinary incontinence.</p>

                <p>A randomized controlled trial has been designed to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of electroacupuncture for female stress urinary incontinence compared with pelvic floor muscle training. The safety of electroacupuncture and patient compliance will also be evaluated. Untoward reaction to the electroacupuncture, including a broken needle, fainting on acupuncture, or pain during acupuncture, will be recorded and the therapy will be stopped if an untoward reaction occurs. After we have received full ethical approval and patient consent, participants will be randomized to receive a series of 24 electroacupuncture or pelvic floor muscle training interventions. The frequency and amount of leakage will be measured as the primary outcome parameters. Secondary outcome parameters include the 1-hour pad test, the short-form of the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire, patient subjective effectiveness evaluation, weekly usage of pad, and usage of specialty therapy for female stress urinary incontinence.</p>

          <p>According to the International Continence Society, stress urinary incontinence (SUI) <abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B1">1</abbr>
             </abbrgrp> is defined as involuntary loss of urine during coughing or sneezing <abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B2">2</abbr>
             </abbrgrp>. Female SUI (FSUI) is a common condition which affects quality of life in women aged 40 to 75&#160;years <abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B3">3</abbr>
             </abbrgrp> (Figure&#160;<figr fid="F1">1</figr>).

             </fig>
          
          <p>In China, the prevalence of urinary incontinence in women is 46.5%, of which SUI makes up 59.6% <abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B4">4</abbr>
             </abbrgrp>. Any women of old age are at high risk of SUI <abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B5">5</abbr>
             </abbrgrp>. Women with SUI are embarrassed to take part in social activities, and as a result their lifestyles are altered putting them at increased risk of lifestyle-related disease, such as osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary disease, mammary cancer, carcinoma of colon, depression, anxiety, and so forth <abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B6">6</abbr>
             </abbrgrp>.</p>
          <p>The International Consultation on Urological Diseases recommend that treatment methods for mild and moderate SUI are lifestyle intervention, behavior therapy, pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training, functional electroacupuncture, and so forth <abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B7">7</abbr>
             </abbrgrp>. PFM training has level A evidence of efficacy, with a curative rate ranging from 30 to 60% <abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B8">8</abbr>
             </abbrgrp>. However, training duration should be at least 2&#160;months. In China, PFM training is not as efficient as expected because there are not enough physical therapists, and patient compliance to treatment needs to be improved <abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B9">9</abbr>
             </abbrgrp>. Primary therapy for moderate and severe SUI is surgery, which carries a high potential for adverse events. A safety communication from the US Food and Drug Administration on serious complications associated with transvaginal placement of a surgical mesh for pelvic organ prolapse was issued on 13 July 2011 <abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B10">10</abbr>
             </abbrgrp>. Therefore, there is a need to explore other treatment avenues.</p>
          <p>By contrast, acupuncture for FSUI works over a short period with a high curative rate <abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B11">11</abbr>
             </abbrgrp>, which shows potential advantages for FSUI. In a previous study <abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B12">12</abbr>
             </abbrgrp>, electroacupunture was verified as a more effective therapy for SUI than acupuncture, possibly related to the PFM and nerves. However, the level of evidence was rated as &#8220;low&#8221; <abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B12">12</abbr>
             </abbrgrp>.</p>
          <p>A trial of high methodological quality is needed to determine whether electroacupuncture is effective for FSUI. This trial will evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture and investigate whether electroacupuncture is a better treatment for FSUI than PFM training.</p>

             <p>This study is a double-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial using two study arms: an electroacupuncture group and a PFM training group.</p>
             <p>After consent, participants will be allocated to either group (the electroacupuncture group or the PFM training group) using computer generated randomization lists. Block randomization was chosen to allow for equal numbers in each group at regular time intervals. These participants will be randomly assigned to the two groups through central randomization in a 1:1 ratio. The central randomization system will be used and performed by the Clinical Evaluation Center at the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences in Beijing. A random number and group assignment will be immediately received by telephone, mobile phone, or website sent from the Clinical Evaluation Center. Participants will receive 24 sessions of electroacupuncture or PFM training over 8&#160;weeks at a frequency of three times per week.</p>

After insertion, the needle will be twirled, lifted and thrust three times until the patient has a needling sensation If the needle breaks during treatment it will be removed and the quality of the other needles will be checked. If a patient faints, the treatment will be suspended until they recover. If a patient feels pain, we will change the needle insertion angle and depth. The electric stimulator is applied to bilateral BL33 and BL35 with a continuous wave, 50&#160;Hz electric current at 1 to 5&#160;mA from the positive pole to the negative pole. The treatment design is based on literature research over the preceding 10&#160;years, former research results and expert consensus.</p></sec>

                <p>The participants are treated continuously for 8&#160;weeks, three times a week on alternate days, giving 24 treatments in total (Additional file <supplr sid="S2">2</supplr>). Before performing PFM training, patients should learn the position of the PFM. The PFM is the muscle we contract to stop passing water when urinating. Alternatively, vaginal palpation can be used to identify the specific position of the PFM. The patient can insert their finger into the vagina to feel the muscle contraction if convenient. PFM training is performed by standing/sitting/lying on the back with knees bent. Continuously contract the PFM three times, until the patient feels they cannot contract any more strongly; then hold on the contraction, and breathe twice (inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale); then relax the whole body, breathing another two times (inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale). Then contract PFM again. Repeat the above procedure for 15&#160;minutes <abbrgrp>

                <p> Difference in mean frequency of leakage over 24&#160;hours based on a 72-hour diary (Additional file <supplr sid="S3">3</supplr>) compared with baseline. The mean frequency of leakage over a 24-hour period is calculated from the 72-hour voiding diaries, measured four times, in weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8. This mean frequency is compared with the baseline frequency measured at week 0.</p>
                   <p> Difference in mean degrees of leakage over 24&#160;hours based on a 72-hour diary, compared with the baseline. The mean quantity of fluid loss over a mean of 24&#160;hours is calculated from the 72-hour voiding diary, measured three times, in weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8. This mean degree of leakage is compared with the baseline mean degree measured at week 0. The degree can be divided into four levels: mild degree (a very small amount of leakage with several drops); moderate degree (moderate leakage which wets the women&#8217;s underwear, but does not wet the over-trousers); and severe degree (a large amount of leakage which wet the over-trousers)</p>

                <p>Scoring for frequency of leakage is defined as: 1&#8201;=&#8201;less than once per month; 2&#8201;=&#8201;several times per month; 3&#8201;=&#8201;several times per week; 4&#8201;=&#8201;every day or night.</p>
                <p>Scoring for amount of leakage is defined as: 1&#8201;=&#8201;a few drops; 2&#8201;=&#8201;small splashes; 3&#8201;=&#8201;more than small splashes.</p>
                <p>Giving a severity index of: mild&#8201;=&#8201;1&#8211;2; moderate&#8201;=&#8201;3&#8211;6; severe&#8201;=&#8201;8&#8211;9; very severe&#8201;=&#8201;12. <abbrgrp>

                <p>All of the primary outcome measures are based on a 72-hour diary. Every 2&#160;weeks, patients will be asked to record the amount of fluid they drink (tea, coffee, milk, water and so forth) and leakage information (what movement they were doing when the leakage happened) for 3 consecutive days. Researchers will calculate the above primary outcome measures according to the patient&#8217;s record.</p>

             <p> Difference in 1-hour pad test, compared with baseline. The quantity of fluid loss will be measured by 1-hour pad test, comparing the value at 8, 20 and 32&#160;weeks with the baseline (0&#160;week); values at 20&#160;weeks are calculated from the total quantity of fluid loss over weeks 17 to 20 divided by 4; values at 32&#160;weeks are calculated from the total quantity of fluid loss over weeks 29 to 32 divided by 4.</p>

This is evaluated at 8, 20 and 32&#160;weeks; values at 8&#160;weeks are calculated by the total score at weeks 6 and 8 divided by 2.</p>
                <p> Patient subjective effectiveness evaluation uses three-point scoring: no help&#8201;=&#8201;0; small help&#8201;=&#8201;1; medium help&#8201;=&#8201;2; great help&#8201;=&#8201;3. This is evaluated at 8, 20 and 32&#160;weeks; values at 8&#160;weeks are made by the patient subjective effectiveness evaluation at week 8. If the 8-week value is not available, week 4 or week 6 can be used as the value at week 8.</p>
                <p> Weekly usage of pad. The value at week 8 is the average weekly usage of pads during weeks 1 to 8; the value at week 20 is the average weekly usage of pads during weeks 9 to 20; the value at week 32 is the average weekly usage of pads during weeks 21 to 32.</p>

             <p>Discussion</p>
          </st>
          <p>The results of this trial are expected to provide convincing evidence whether acupuncture is a more effective method for patients with SUI than PFM training. The trial is sponsored and financially supported by &#8220;the Twelfth Five-year Plan&#8221; from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, which is the most important basic research program based on clinical practice.</p>
          <p>The proposed study presents the first high quality randomized controlled trial on electroacupuncture for FSUI. As identified in a recently published review and a systematic review and meta analysis (Wang Y, Zhishun L, Peng W, Zhao J, Liu B, manuscript accepted), only a few studies have investigated electroacupuncture for FSUI <abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B17">17</abbr>
             </abbrgrp>,<abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B18">18</abbr>
             </abbrgrp>. None of these was adequately powered to allow valid conclusions on its optimal effectiveness. Additional risk of bias was introduced by methodological issues, such as invalid randomization procedures and unclear blinding, leading to a grading of the current level of evidence as &#8220;low&#8221; <abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B10">10</abbr>
             </abbrgrp>. Therefore, we are conducting a multicenter, randomized, controlled large-scale trial to clarify whether electroacupuncture is more effective than PFM training in treating SUI.</p>
          <p>There are two different treatment groups in this trial: the electroacupuncture group and the PFM training group. Bilateral Zhong Liao and Hui Yang are applied in the electroacupuncture group, which are regarded as the most common acupuncture prescriptions. The electric stimulator is applied to bilateral BL33 and BL35 with a continuous wave, 50&#160;Hz, 1 to 5&#160;mA electric current, which is expected to be the best therapeutic effect. PFM training has received Level A evidence rating in the treatment of SUI in women, based on meta-analyses of numerous randomized control trials, and is recommended in many published guidelines <abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B19">19</abbr>
             </abbrgrp>. Thus, PFM training is used as the control group.</p>
          <p>In this trial, we use a 1:1 randomization design comparing electroacupuncture to PFM training to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture, and investigate whether electroacupuncture is a better treatment for SUI in comparison to PFM training. The sample size estimation ensures adequate power (90%) to allow valid conclusions. With the high prevalence of SUI and the socioeconomic burden of SUI, there is a demand for effective, safe, non-invasive and low-cost treatment options for this specific patient group. The primary outcome measures are based on authoritative literatures on comparable study interventions <abbrgrp>
                <abbr bid="B20">20</abbr>
             </abbrgrp>.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the results of this trial are expected to confirm the effectiveness of electroacupuncture and whether it is a better treatment for SUI compared with PFM training.</p>
