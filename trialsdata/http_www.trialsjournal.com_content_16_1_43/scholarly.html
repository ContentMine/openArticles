               </div>
               <p>For children requiring split-thickness skin grafting for burn injury, the optimum
                  donor site dressing is an ongoing subject of debate. The most common dressings in
                  use, both regionally and worldwide, are calcium alginates. We will compare an alginate
                  with two other dressings, all of which are in current use in the Pegg Leditschke Paediatric
                  Burns Centre (PLPBC), to determine which dressing performs the best.

               </div>
               <p>This is a randomised, prospective single center parallel three-arm trial comparing
                  three donor site wound (DSW) dressings: Algisite™ M, a calcium alginate dressing;
                  Cuticerin™, a smooth acetate gauze impregnated with water-repellent ointment (petrolatum,
                  paraffin and Eucerite®) and Sorbact®, a gauze mesh coated with a dialkylcarbamoyl
                  chloride (DACC) and amorphous hydrogel.
               </p>
               <p>Primary outcomes are days to complete DSW healing, and pain. Previously validated
                  measures will be used for all outcomes. Secondary outcomes are: itch; scar appearance
                  at three, six and 12 months; ease of dressing application and removal and dressing
                  costs and utility. Results will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Donor
                  site thickness will be measured with a small biopsy from the center of the graft,
                  to document the depth of the DSW across the groups.

               <p>This study will provide comprehensive short- and long-term data on DSW dressings in
                  pediatric split-thickness skin grafting. The best-performing dressing will become

                  other dressings can be compared in future, recognising that alginates are the most
                  common DSW dressing currently in use. Our study design replicates a real-world scenario
                  in order to identify clinically significant differences between the three dressings.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Split-thickness skin grafting (STSG) is the most widely used method of achieving skin
         coverage in burns that are not predicted to heal rapidly with dressings. In harvesting
         skin to cover the defect, a second wound is created, the donor site wound (DSW). In
         children, this wound is predicted to re-epithelialise in seven to 14 days. The ideal
         DSW dressing does not adhere to the wound bed, facilitating removal. DSW dressings
         should be pain-free, reduce blood loss and be changed infrequently; ideally not until
         the wound has healed 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>. Among clinicians, a pain-free dressing is the most consistently desirable or essential
         quality of a wound dressing, in recognition of the fact that the DSW is often more
         painful than the recipient site 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>. The need for such a dressing is, if anything, more important in pediatric burn care
         as there are data suggesting that decreased pain leads to measurable and clinically
         significant improvements in wound healing 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>. Additionally, rapid healing permits the repeat harvesting of donor areas in larger
         burns and also decreases the risk of scarring 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>The optimum dressing for the DSW is unclear, with surgeon and centre choice appearing
         to follow tradition stemming from eminence as often as it follows selection stemming
         from evidence. Alginates are the most commonly used DSW dressing 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>. There are four systematic reviews investigating DSW dressings 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span>, none of which have identified a single dressing with a clearly superior performance.
         Data are particularly lacking in pediatric burns, and new dressings are being developed
         continually. There is a clear need for high quality evidence in pediatric DSW dressings.
      </p>
      <p>Due to the sparse data available, and in recognition of the variety of dressings in
         our unit, we aim to investigate DSW dressings currently in use in the PLPBC. This
         trial seeks to answer the following question: in pediatric STSGs, which of the three
         DSW dressings currently in use at our institution (Algisite™ M, Cuticerin™ and Sorbact®)
         is superior in terms of pain and itch, wound healing, ease of application and removal,
         scarring and costs? The best-performing dressing will become our preferred standard,
         against which we are likely to subsequently repeat the trial as newer dressings become
         available.

            <h3>The Pegg Leditschke Paediatric Burns Centre</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The Pegg Leditschke Paediatric Burns Centre (PLPBC) is the major pediatric burns centre
            for Queensland and Northern New South Wales in Australia, serving a population of
            approximately 4.5 million. The PLPBC treats approximately 750 new burns annually.
            A total of 79 patients received split-thickness skin grafts in 2013. The majority
            of patients have small areas requiring grafting, and our preferred donor site is the
            thigh or buttock. On occasion grafts from the adjacent skin are used to combine donor
            and graft sites into a single dressing site. Facial burns are preferentially treated
            with scalp grafts whereas larger burns may require using the back as a donor site.
         </p>
         <p>The PLPBC promotes ‘bench to bedside, and back to bench’ burns care. Clinical questions
            drive our research efforts, the result of which alter clinical care and in turn generate
            the next round of research questions. The centre has research and prevention arms,
            as well a clinical multidisciplinary team. The PLPBC has numerous publications in
            pediatric burns across many different aspects of this care; laboratory, clinical burns
            care, patient and family response to burn injury, prevention, rehabilitation, physio-
            and occupational therapy and procedural pain control and distraction modalities.

         <p>We have designed a single centre prospective parallel randomised controlled trial
            with three treatment groups (Figure 
            <div tagx="figr">1</div>). There is no control arm in the generally accepted sense, but we recognise many
            will view alginates as a 
            <i>de facto</i> control arm. Equipoise exists for this trial as there is no generally accepted DSW
            dressing among burns surgeons in general, and among the PLPBC surgeons in particular.
            We deem it unethical to have an inactive control arm as our purpose is to find which
            of three current dressings is superior.

         <p>There is uniformity in the application of all three dressings within the PLPBC; all
            are dressings that are already in use. Three different DSW dressings will be used:
            Algisite™ M, an alginate dressing (Smith &amp; Nephew, Hull, United Kingdom); Cuticerin™,
            a smooth acetate gauze impregnated with water repellent ointment (petrolatum, paraffin
            and Eucerite®) (Smith &amp; Nephew, Hull, United Kingdom) and Sorbact®, a gauze mesh coated
            with a dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (DACC) and amorphous hydrogel (Abigo Medical AB,
            Gothenburg, Sweden). DACC is a synthetic fatty acid derivative. This dressing is designed
            to cause a hydrophobic interaction between bacteria and the dressing, lifting them
            from the wound bed in a moist environment

         </p>
         <p>We no longer routinely use open weave paraffin gauze or similar dressings directly
            on DSWs. The large mesh spaces in these dressings can lead to incorporation during
            re-epithelialisation which in turn can cause pain and bleeding on dressing removal.
            Further, leaving such a dressing on until spontaneous separation risks a permanent
            pattern on the DSW scar

            <h3>Surgical procedure</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The grafting procedure will be performed with a pneumatic dermatome (Zimmer Inc.,
            Warsaw, Indiana, United States), according to local practice. The STSG will be harvested
            at between 0.005 and 0.008 of an inch (0.13 to 0.20 mm), according to surgeon preference
            and the age of the patient. It is anticipated that the majority will be taken with
            the dermatome set at 0.007 of an inch (0.18 mm), as this is the default local setting.
            The particular dermatome used will be recorded, as will the ‘swipe number’ of the
            dermatome blade in use at the time, the donor site and the surgeon harvesting the
            graft. A small lentiform biopsy will be taken from the center of each graft, blocked,
            cut and measured for graft thickness. Any remaining donor skin at the conclusion of
            the case will be similarly treated. This will allow more confidence regarding DSW
            depth when analysing results.
         </p>
         <p>Following harvesting, local anesthetic (bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 1:200,000
            AstraZeneca Pty Ltd, North Ryde, NSW 2113, Australia) is applied directly onto the
            wound up to the maximum safe dose calculated from the weight of the child (2 to 2.5 mg/kg,
            depending on the child and any co-morbidities). Post-harvest topical application of
            local anesthetic was chosen rather than pre-harvest infiltration in order to further
            standardise the DSW, as infiltration was felt to be more variable. Topical local anesthetic
            gives good pain relief in DSWs 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
            </span>. In longer cases donor sites may be temporarily dressed with epinephrine and/or saline-soaked
            gauze (1 mg/1,000 mL NaCl), with or without pressure dressings, to facilitate hemostasis.
            The DSW is formally dressed at the end of the case, following dressing of the grafted
            site. One of the three dressings is applied directly to the wound; followed by an
            absorbent second layer of Allevyn™ and a Hypafix™ securement dressing (Smith &amp; Nephew,
            Hull, United Kingdom). The majority of patients are sent home the same day.

            <h3>Wound treatment</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Randomisation occurs immediately before the definitive DSW dressing is applied. Where
            space between donor sites permits (for example, between the left thigh and right thigh),
            a second randomisation is permitted. Each wound then constitutes its own study entity
            and will be analysed separately.
         </p>
         <p>The DSW dressing is taken down in clinic on the seventh post-operative day. Our current
            standard dressing following this first dressing change is Xeroform® (Covidien, Mansfield
            Massachusetts, United States) 3% bismuth tribromophenate occlusive petrolatum gauze,
            which will be applied to all DSWs from this point. We expect the majority of wounds
            to be healed or nearly healed at seven days, from clinical observation. We have no
            experience using any of the three study dressings on a DSW beyond this first dressing
            change.
         </p>
         <p>Clinics occur every weekday, and each patient is seen twice weekly after the first
            dressing change. This is predicated on ongoing treatment for the grafted site. By
            reviewing the donor dressing on these occasions we will avoid a requirement for additional
            clinic visits. Reviewing the dressings every three days after the first week replicates
            a real-world scenario and means that our results, if positive, will have clinical
            significance for this outcome.

            <h3>Co-interventions</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Reinforcement of the primary dressing is permitted as per standard clinical practice.
            In such cases the reinforcing dressing, and the reason/s for applying it, will be
            recorded. On occasion children, parents or other health care providers outside the
            hospital remove the dressing within the first week. Should this occur, the study dressing
            will be reapplied and reasons for the early removal will be documented.
         </p>
         <p>Interventions at dressing change, such as debridement, cleansing or coverage with
            cling-film prior to review are permitted in all arms, reflecting a real-life approach.
            In the case of a suspected or diagnosed wound infection the wound may be treated with
            antimicrobial agents (povidone iodine and/or nanocrystalline silver dressings). Common
            definitions for superficial surgical site infections (SSI) are predicated on an incisional,
            rather than excisional wound 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
            </span> and their appropriateness for DSW infection is questionable. We have taken a clinical
            approach based on the definition of a superficial SSI. Diagnosis of wound infection
            in this trial is by agreement of the treating clinician and a second burns surgeon.
            Criteria used for defining wound infection are qualitative, and include purulent discharge
            from the DSW surface; serous or haemoserous discharge alone does not constitute infection.
            Inflammation extending beyond the margins of the DSW at dressing change is another
            criterion. A surface swab is inaccurate and has a long lead time, but will nonetheless
            be performed for a colony count as it may provide some quantitative data in support
            of the diagnosis. A positive swab alone does not constitute an infection. We do not
            perform punch biopsies of our patients in clinic. As part of the dressing protocol
            these wounds will all be photographed.
         </p>
         <p>Standard analgesia will be provided to all children. For larger total body surface
            area (TBSA) wounds it is our practice to augment this with gabapentin and/or antihistamines
            in an effort to decrease itch. These medications are surgeon dependent. All medications
            will be recorded.

               <h4>Primary endpoints</h4>
            </div>
            <p>There are two primary endpoints: pain, and time to re-epithelialisation. Pain will
               be assessed at several time points. Firstly, at four hours following completion of
               the operation. This will allow measurement in day-case patients prior to their discharge.
               By taking these scores face to face we hope to facilitate the telephone call the following
               day. It is also an opportunity to clarify directly with parents that we are scoring
               DSW pain, rather than graft site pain. Secondly, at one day later via a telephone
               call, or following ward review for inpatients. Thirdly, immediately before premedication
               prior to removal of the DSW dressing in clinic. Premedication will be with oxycodone
               0.1 mg/kg orally (Mundipharma Pty Ltd, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia), and oral paracetamol
               150 mg/kg (sanofi-aventis Australia Pty Ltd, Macquarie Park, NSW 2113, Australia).
               Fourthly, at two minutes following removal of the DSW dressing. The graft dressing
               will not be taken down until after these scores are recorded. If a dressing is reapplied,
               the recordings at time points two, three and four above will be repeated for each
               subsequent change.
            </p>
            <p>A variety of scales will be used for assessing pain, determined by who is performing
               the assessment (observer, parent or child), and by the age of the child. The face,
               legs, activity, cry and consolability (FLACC) scale will be used by nursing staff
               
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
               </span>. Where children are old enough, the Revised Faces Pain Scale (FPS-R) will be used
               for patient self-reporting of pain 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">21</span>
               </span>. We will collect FPS-R data for children aged from three years, recognising that
               data are sparse for children below the age of five years 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">21</span>
               </span>. Parents will use an 11-point (0 to 10) numeric rating scale (NRS). This, rather
               than a visual analogue scale, was chosen to facilitate the accuracy of recording during
               a telephone call.
            </p>
            <p>Re-epithelialisation is defined as over 95% wound healing and no requirement for further
               wound dressing. Scabs or crusts are defined as unhealed areas. This endpoint is doubly
               assessed. In the clinic the treating doctor assesses percentage re-epithelialisation.
               It is further assessed from digital photography by an independent surgeon blinded
               to the DSW dressing. Photographs will be taken at each dressing change and at each
               subsequent clinic visit for care. In the clinic a visual percentage re-epithelialisation
               will be requested. The blinded observer will subsequently mark out the edges of the
               wound, and any unhealed areas. Surface area computer mapping will then be used to
               determine percentage re-epithelialisation. We will test concordance between clinician
               assessment and computer mapping regarding re-epithelialisation.

               <h4>Secondary endpoints</h4>
            </div>
            <p>Itch is a secondary endpoint. The Itch Man Scale will be used for assessing itch.
               This scale has been validated in children 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">22</span>
               </span>. These assessments will occur at the same time as the pain scores above. Itch will
               also be assessed at the three, six and 12 month reviews. DSW appearance at three,
               six and 12 months is a secondary endpoint. This will be assessed in a number of ways:
               ultrasound measurement of scar thickness; digital three-dimensional photography and
               edge marking to determine computer-mapped areas of scarring. This will be compared
               with previous digital images; Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">23</span>
               </span>. We chose POSAS as this has superior performance in a systematic review over other
               scar assessment scales, and from a pragmatic viewpoint is the scale PLPBC staff are
               most familiar with 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">24</span>
               </span>. It also seeks the opinions of the patient regarding their scar, something we consider
               important. In practice for many of our young children we use the parent opinion. Where
               possible we ask both parent and patient. There are some reliability data supporting
               the use of this scale in children above the age of six years 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">25</span>
               </span>. Below this age caregiver opinion will be sought as a proxy for the child.
            </p>
            <p>Ease of dressing application and removal is a secondary endpoint. Setup time will
               not be recorded; times for removal and reapplication of dressing will be recorded.
               A numeric rating scale (0 to four) will be used to ascertain opinions regarding ease
               of dressing removal at first change. Ease of dressing measurements in theatre are
               confounded by lack of blinding, and by the variable nature and size of the areas to
               be dressed. Ease of dressing scores in clinic will focus primarily on the ease with
               which the primary dressing is removed from the skin surface.
            </p>
            <p>Cost is a secondary endpoint. This will be assessed using hospital pricing for the
               dressings used, and nursing time for dressing changes. Additional visits, where required,
               will also be included in the cost analysis. Routine visits will not be costed, since
               these are a standard part of treatment. Any additional treatments outside of standard
               care, such as treatment for infection, will be included in costing. A cost-utility
               analysis will not be performed, as the site and nature of the burn wound grafted will
               confound quality of life results. We will thus not be able to isolate the DSW from
               the grafted site in order to perform cost-utility on the DSW alone.

            <h3>Randomisation</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Randomisation will occur in the operating theatre, immediately prior to application
            of the DSW dressing. We have used unrestricted randomisation, generated using an online
            program (
            <a href="http://stattrek.com/">http://stattrek.com/</a>)

            minimum of 28 participants reaching the primary endpoints. Allocation concealment
            will be via the use of sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes pre-prepared
            by a third party.
         </p>
         <p>Patients will be recruited into the trial when a decision to graft is made following
            review of the burn injury. The patient will be randomised intra-operatively, further
            separating recruitment and consent from randomisation.

            <h3>Blinding</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The nature of the study mitigates against full blinding, but some assessments can
            be blinded. Secondary dressings for all patients are the same, so clinic staff will
            not initially know which arm the patient is in. Clinic staff, patients and parents
            are blinded for assessments of pain and itch until the first dressing change. Following
            that point, blinding is not possible for the remainder of the pain and itch assessments
            as the dressing will have been revealed.
         </p>
         <p>One of the assessors of re-epithelialisation will be blinded, as these assessments
            will take place using digital photography. Details of the dressing will not be made
            available to this assessor. Where there is discrepancy between these two observations,
            the blinded assessor will be taken as the definitive assessment in an effort to overcome
            performance bias. The assessments of scar appearance will also be blinded, as assessors
            will have no knowledge of the dressing used.

         </div>
         <p>The sample size calculation was derived from the primary outcomes. Dressings are changed
            every three days after the first week, and we have used three days as a minimum clinically
            important difference (MCID) for re-epithelialisation. The standard deviation (SD)
            on DSW healing, from our database, is four days. We have chosen to power the study
            to 80%, with an α of 0.05, requiring 28 participants in each group. This sample size
            is also adequate to determine an MCID of 2 (SD 2.5) in our pain scores using the FLACC
            and the NRS.
         </p>
         <p>We will use simple randomisation in order to maintain the same degree of DSW dressing
            unpredictability for each subject. Recruitment will continue until there are at least
            28 participants in each arm with primary outcome data. A two-year recruitment period
            is anticipated, based upon the number of eligible patients requiring grafting in our
            unit in previous years.

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>For such a commonly created wound, it is surprising that there is no uniform dressing
         choice for DSWs 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>. There are a number of possible reasons for this: multiple dressings may have equivalent
         efficacy; more attention is focused on the grafted site, and the DSW is seen as a
         secondary priority and there are a lack of reliable and valid data regarding dressing
         choices.
      </p>
      <p>While there are a number of trials and systematic reviews, heterogeneity between studies
         makes direct comparisons difficult 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span>. Tentative recommendations support the use of dressings designed to create a moist
         healing environment. The majority of studies have been performed in adults. While
         it is tempting to extrapolate adult data to a pediatric setting this may not be entirely
         appropriate. Children’s skin is different to adults, and its thickness varies by site,
         age and gender 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">28</span>
         </span>, therefore trials in children may not have the same results as those in adults.
      </p>
      <p>PLPBC DSW dressings are determined largely by surgeon preference and dressing availability
         on the day of surgery. For external readers this trial will provide data for two dressings
         against the active control of a calcium alginate. With rigorous trial design, we hope
         to be able to re-use this protocol in future should additional dressings become available,
         which may offer advantages over our chosen DSW dressing.
      </p>
      <p>Our trial is intentionally pragmatic; we aim to replicate current clinical practice
         as closely as possible. We do not, for example, impose additional visits on participants.
         We are looking for outcomes that are clinically significant, and have chosen endpoints
         that are important to clinicians, and to patients and their families. Where possible
         we have used blinded assessments to second-read decisions in clinic. The scales we
         have chosen have been previously validated in children, and we have experience in
         all scales that will be used in this trial. This is the first trial of DSW wound healing
         that incorporates measurement of the harvested graft thickness into the study protocol.
         This will enable us to correlate healing with donor thickness.
      </p>
      <p>Pain is a primary outcome of interest to parents and clinicians alike, as well as
         to the patient. Data are mixed on donor site pain, but the majority of studies do
         agree that DSW pain is often more severe than graft site pain. This is not a surprising
         finding given the nature of the two wounds. A donor site more painful than its corresponding
         recipient site has an associated eponym; a positive Moriarty sign is said to be a
         reassuring sign of impending graft take, rather than graft failure 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Time to healing is a relevant primary outcome. Faster re-epithelialisation allows
         us to re-harvest the donor site, as well as limiting the timespan of this iatrogenic
         injury. We try where possible to avoid meshed grafts, as the final appearance is cosmetically
         inferior.
      </p>
      <p>There are a paucity of data on the long-term appearance of a DSW. Much scar studies
         have focused on the grafted site and DSW scars as well. The Queensland climate is
         warm, and children often have their thighs uncovered. In our climate the DSW may be
         more on view than the grafted site itself, as our most common burn injury is a scald
         to the anterior chest. Scar appearance is a secondary outcome. Scarring is related
         to the depth of injury, so to accommodate this variable we will be measuring the depth
         of the STSG at each donor site.

      </div>
      <p>The first patient was randomised intra-operatively on 17 April 2014. As of 1 August
         2014 we had recruited 36 patients. A total of 34 have been grafted and randomised
         to one of the three dressings, with a further two awaiting surgery.
