                  <h3>Background</h3>
               </div>
               <p>It had been reported that up to 37% of the adult male population smokes cigarettes
                  in Qatar. The Global Youth Tobacco Survey also stated that 13.4% of male school students
                  aged 13 to 15 years in Qatar smoke cigarettes. Smoking cessation is key to reducing
                  smoking-related diseases and deaths. Healthcare providers are in an ideal position
                  to encourage smoking cessation. Pharmacists are the most accessible healthcare providers
                  and are uniquely situated to initiate behavior change among patients. Many studies
                  have shown that pharmacists can be successful in helping patients quit smoking. Studies
                  demonstrating the effectiveness of pharmacist-delivered smoking cessation programs
                  are lacking in Qatar. This proposal aims to test the effect of a structured smoking
                  cessation program delivered by trained ambulatory pharmacists in Qatar.

                  <h3>Methods/Design</h3>
               </div>
               <p>A prospective, randomized, controlled trial is conducted at eight ambulatory pharmacies
                  in Qatar. Participants are randomly assigned to receive an at least four-session face-to-face
                  structured patient-specific smoking cessation program conducted by the pharmacist
                  or 5 to 10 min of unstructured brief smoking cessation advice (emulating current practice)
                  given by the pharmacist. Both groups are offered nicotine replacement therapy if feasible.
                  The primary outcome of smoking cessation will be confirmed by an exhaled carbon monoxide
                  test at 12 months. Secondary outcomes constitute quality-of-life adjustment as well
                  as cost analysis of program resources consumed, including per case and patient outcome.

               <p>If proven to be effective, this smoking cessation program will be considered as a
                  model that Qatar and the region can apply to decrease the smoking burden.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The leading preventable cause of ill health today is cigarette smoking 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. It is a major risk factor for several causes of death including heart disease, chronic
         lung diseases and lung cancer 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. It kills one in ten adults globally and causes more than 5 million deaths annually.
         If present trends continue, the number of smoking-related deaths is expected to reach
         more than 8 million deaths per year by 2030 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>. The adverse health consequences of tobacco use not only compromise smokers’ quality
         of life, but also entail significant direct and indirect economic costs on society.
         The 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) report states that the global healthcare
         costs attributable to tobacco use reach hundreds of billions of US dollars each year
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>. Smoking cessation is key to reducing the number of smoking-related diseases and
         deaths. At any age, quitting smoking improves quality of life (QoL) and confers considerable
         health benefits including reduced risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and smoking-related
         cancers 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>. The World Bank suggests that if adult tobacco consumption were to decrease by 50%
         by the year 2020, approximately 180 million tobacco-related deaths could be avoided
         between now and 2050 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>. Health professionals are in an ideal position to encourage smoking cessation. A
         short intervention by them can considerably increase the smoking cessation rate 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>. Of all health professionals, pharmacists are the most easily accessed by the public
         and are uniquely situated to initiate behavior change among smokers 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>. They can provide education and advice without prior appointment and with no direct
         or additional cost to individuals 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>. They regularly interact with patients obtaining medications for smoking-related
         diseases. In addition, the increased availability of pharmacologic smoking cessation
         aids including some formulations of nicotine replacement therapy over the counter
         in pharmacies in many countries gives the pharmacists a distinct opportunity to serve
         as front-line health providers who can play a major smoking cessation role 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span>. Moreover, available data support the provision of smoking cessation services in
         ambulatory and community pharmacies. Many studies have shown that pharmacists can
         be effective providers of tobacco cessation interventions and can be successful in
         helping patients quit smoking 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
         </span> and that these pharmacy interventions can be cost-effective or cost-beneficial 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">21</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">24</span>
         </span>. Additionally, in many countries there is extensive support at the professional level
         for the involvement of pharmacists in smoking cessation. The Canadian Pharmacists
         Association developed a Joint Statement on Smoking Cessation. This statement promotes
         the involvement of health professionals including pharmacists in tobacco prevention
         and cessation 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>. The International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) issued a statement of policy on
         the role of pharmacists in promoting a tobacco-free future 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">25</span>
         </span>. The European Forum adopted a pharmacists’ charter on action against smoking, which
         states that pharmacists should consider smoking cessation as an essential element
         of their professional responsibilities 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">26</span>
         </span>. The US Public Health Service published evidence-based clinical guidelines recommending
         that all health care providers, including pharmacists, should offer smoking-cessation
         interventions 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">27</span>
         </span>. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists’ (ASHP) Therapeutic Position Statement
         on the Cessation of Tobacco Use strongly encourages pharmacists as well as other healthcare
         providers to integrate identification of tobacco users and delivery of tobacco-cessation
         interventions into their routine patient care. As per the ASHP statement, these interventions
         should address five key elements of comprehensive tobacco cessation counseling (the
         5 As): (1) asking patients about tobacco use, (2) advising users to quit, (3) assessing
         their readiness to quit, (4) assisting them with quitting using behavior modification
         and smoking cessation medications, and (5) arranging follow-up care. If comprehensive
         tobacco-cessation counseling cannot be provided because of time constraints or practice
         site logistics, pharmacists can use a truncated 5 A model whereby they ask about tobacco
         use, advise tobacco users to quit, and then refer patients to smoking cessation providers
         or programs 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">28</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>In Qatar, tobacco use is a major public health problem that, in addition to the associated
         morbidity and mortality, constitutes a huge burden on healthcare services. To control
         tobacco use, Qatar has adopted the international approaches recommended by the World
         Health Organization (WHO) and regional plan of Arab countries in the Gulf. These approaches
         are based on three strategies: (1) imposing legislative tobacco control measures,
         for example, banning smoking in enclosed public places and prohibiting selling cigarettes,
         tobacco or its derivatives to anyone less than 18 years old, (2) providing smoking
         cessation services for free in two hospital-based smoking cessation clinics and (3)
         implementing antismoking public awareness activities 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">29</span>
         </span>. Despite these approaches, in Qatar up to 37% of adult males currently smoke tobacco
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">30</span>
         </span> and 13.4% of male school students aged 13 to 15 years smoke cigarettes according
         to the 2007 Global Youth Tobacco Survey 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">31</span>
         </span>. Furthermore, smoking-related diseases are the most prevalent in Qatar. Ischemic
         heart disease, as an example, was ranked as one of the leading causes of burden of
         disease in Qatar in 2010 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">32</span>
         </span>, and Qatar has a higher age standardized lung cancer incidence rate than many countries
         in the Gulf (8.95 per 100,000) 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">33</span>
         </span>. In addition, according to a recent survey done by Weill Cornell Medical College
         in Qatar, at least 1 billion cigarettes are smoked in Qatar each year, averaging 12,000
         per individual, and 65 million US dollars (USD) are spent on cigarettes annually;
         150 million USD are used to cover the healthcare costs of patients affected by smoking-related
         diseases 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">34</span>
         </span>. The potential for pharmacist-assisted tobacco cessation is therefore huge and could
         have a considerable impact on smoking rates, prevention of tobacco-related diseases
         and enhancement of public health in Qatar. Around 700 registered pharmacists practice
         in public and private ambulatory care clinics and in community pharmacies in Qatar.
         If each of these pharmacists successfully assists just one tobacco user in quitting
         each month, this would result in more than 8500 quitters annually. However, according
         to a study conducted by Qatar University’s College of Pharmacy and funded by the Qatar
         Foundation under its Undergraduate Research Experience Program (UREP), Qatar’s ambulatory
         and community pharmacists are not fully engaged in smoking cessation activities. Eighty
         percent of Qatar’s ambulatory and community pharmacists rarely, never or sometimes
         ask their patients about their smoking status, and 53% rarely, never or sometimes
         offer smoking cessation counseling to nicotine therapy purchasers. When meeting patients
         who smoke, only 45% of pharmacists discuss the adverse health effects of smoking,
         41% assist them in quitting and 16% arrange follow-up sessions with them to assess
         their progress in quitting smoking. However, more than 85% of pharmacists are interested
         in providing smoking cessation counseling and believe that it is an important activity
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">35</span>
         </span>. The pharmacists’ perceptions regarding the importance of smoking cessation can be
         transformed into action if a smoking cessation model is provided that these pharmacists
         can use in routine practice. Unfortunately, an intensive, patient-specific program
         of smoking cessation designed exclusively for implementation in community and ambulatory
         pharmacies is not available in Qatar. In addition, evidence regarding the effect of
         such a program is lacking in Qatar.
      </p>
      <p>Also important, in addition to the numerous knowledge gaps identified above in relation
         to Qatar, there are also no data on how cost beneficial the running of smoking cessation
         programs like the currently proposed one is, added to a lacking data on the associated
         resource implications in the pharmacy setting from the Qatari perspective.

            <h3>Study objectives</h3>
         </div>
         <p>This proposal describes a study that is currently being implemented in eight public
            and private ambulatory clinic pharmacies in Qatar. Our hypothesis is that a patient-specific
            structured smoking cessation program delivered by smoking cessation-trained ambulatory
            pharmacists would be significantly more effective in helping smokers stop smoking
            and achieving long-term smoking abstinence than brief unstructured pharmacist-delivered
            advice.
         </p>
         <p>We also hypothesize that quitting smoking would lead to significant improvement in
            health-related quality of life.
         </p>
         <p>The study objectives are:</p>
         <p> Primary: To test the effect of a face-to-face structured patient-specific smoking
            cessation program delivered by trained ambulatory pharmacists on smoking cessation
            rates in Qatar
         </p>
         <p> Secondary: To assess the change in health-related quality of life in quitters vs.
            non-quitters
         </p>
         <p> Secondary: To explore the resource utilization of implementing the smoking cessation
            program as delivered by the ambulatory pharmacists in Qatar. This is a cost analysis
            of the overall cost of running the proposed patient-specific cessation program, including
            cost-effectiveness analyses.

         <p>The study is a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness
            of a face-to-face structured patient-specific smoking cessation program conducted

            <h3>Study sites</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The study is implemented in eight public and private ambulatory pharmacies in the
            State of Qatar. These pharmacies are located within large ambulatory clinics that
            serve a large proportion of the Qatar population. To prevent cross contamination with
            the study, none of these clinics has established smoking cessation programs. Each
            study pharmacy is staffed by at least three pharmacists. Two pharmacists from each
            pharmacy are invited to participate in the study. The study is taking place in a semiprivate
            area in the pharmacy. This area is secluded enough to ensure adequate patient confidentiality.

            <h3>Study pharmacists’ training</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Prior to starting the study, each study site pharmacist was sent a copy of the study
            methodology along with a written literature review on smoking cessation and asked
            to study the material.
         </p>
         <p>Two to three weeks after receipt of the material, the study pharmacist attended a
            2-day (8 h/day) smoking cessation training workshop that was organized by the Hamad
            Medical Corporation (HMC) smoking cessation clinic team and Qatar University (QU)
            College of Pharmacy.
         </p>
         <p>The training team consisted of Dr. Ahmed al Mulla (Public Health and Disease Control
            Consultant and HMC smoking cessation clinic head), Dr. Maguy El Hajj (Study Principal
            Investigator/Assistant Professor and CPP Chair at QU College of Pharmacy), Dr. Nadir
            Kheir (Associate Professor and CPPD coordinator at QU College of Pharmacy) and Dr.
            Mohamad Haniki Nik Mohamed [Deputy Dean (Academic Affairs) in Kulliyyahof Pharmacy
            at the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM)]. Dr. Haniki is considered
            an international authority in the area of substance abuse, including cigarette smoking.
         </p>
         <p>The HMC smoking cessation clinic is one of the smoking cessation facilities in Qatar.
            The clinic is run by highly qualified smoking cessation consultants and has a smoking
            cessation success rate of 40%. In addition to offering smoking cessation treatment,
            this clinic contributes to community education on the dangers of smoking among the
            citizens and residents of Qatar and provides smoking-related lectures and seminars
            for all age groups in the state 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">36</span>
            </span>.
         </p>
         <p>The general objective of this workshop is to provide the study pharmacists with enough
            smoking cessation knowledge and the necessary skills and tools to assess and treat
            smokers. A smoking cessation training manual that was developed by the study training
            team is extensively used in the workshop. This manual is also used as an on-site resource
            by the study pharmacists in their smoking cessation program.
         </p>
         <p>The workshop covered the following: smoking epidemiology and risks, benefits of quitting,
            a transtheoretical model for behavior change as applied to smoking cessation, the
            necessary elements for documentation in the patient smoking cessation profile, behavioral
            modification techniques, classification of smokers according to their stage of change
            (5 stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action and maintenance),
            nicotine replacement therapy (NRT: nicotine patch, lozenge and gum), patient counseling
            techniques, development of a personalized action plan, use of the exhaled carbon monoxide
            test, detailed instructions on the program methodology and other needed elements.
         </p>
         <p>In addition, the pharmacists’ training workshop included training the pharmacists
            on how to follow the study protocol exactly. The study team walked the pharmacists
            through the study protocol including how to randomly allocate participants to the
            intervention and control groups, how to deliver the intervention and how to deal with
            control patients.
         </p>
         <p>During the training workshops, emphasis was also placed on the importance of behavioral
            and lifestyle modifications. Pharmacists were instructed to encourage smokers who
            are anticipating quitting to identify the situations that may increase their risk
            of smoking such as having smokers within the household or at the workplace as well
            as getting into stressful situations. After identifying these situations, the pharmacists
            were provided with information they could give to smokers about strategies to improve
            coping including lifestyle changes to decrease stress and improve QoL, removing visual
            cues for smoking and staying away from these situations that normally make patients
            want to smoke 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">37</span>
            </span>. In addition, the pharmacists were trained to provide the smokers with information
            about what to expect during quit attempts and to address any individual concerns that
            the smokers may have 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">38</span>
            </span>. Furthermore, they were advised to encourage the smokers to notify family and friends
            of the plan to quit and to ask for their support 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">37</span>
            </span>.
         </p>
         <p>Participant counseling and interviewing techniques were also part of the training
            workshops. To enhance learning, the pharmacists applied these techniques using patient
            role-plays in small groups. Topics that were reviewed included counseling skills,
            verbal and nonverbal communication skills including use of empathy and active listening,
            use of open-ended and priming questions, verification of patient understanding, overcoming
            of communication barriers, communication with difficult patients, communication with
            patients not interested in discussing smoking cessation and use of strategies to improve
            medication adherence.
         </p>
         <p>Documentation was an important element of the workshop. The pharmacists were trained
            to document the patient’s smoking, medical and medication history, basic demographic
            characteristics, staging, assessment, education, counseling, follow-up and the personalized
            action plan to quit smoking. In addition, they were instructed on how to fill in the
            Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence (FTND). The FTND is a six-item questionnaire
            designed to assist the healthcare professional in determining a patient’s degree of
            nicotine dependence 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">39</span>
            </span>. This questionnaire has already been used in smoking-related research studies in
            the Middle East area 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">

            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">41</span>
            </span>. Furthermore, they were instructed to measure the smoker’s health-related QoL using
            the Smoking Cessation Quality of Life (SCQOL) questionnaire. This instrument was developed
            and validated for use in smoking cessation 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">

            <h3>Study/program marketing</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The study pharmacists were trained to recognize many opportunities for the promotion
            of the smoking cessation program as possible. For example, when dispensing prescriptions,
            the study pharmacists were encouraged to ask patients about smoking and to tell them
            about the smoking cessation program. In addition, study site pharmacists displayed
            posters and leaflets in their pharmacy describing the smoking cessation program. Furthermore,
            the general practitioners and dentists practicing in the study ambulatory clinics
            were sent letters inviting them to refer their patients who are interested in quitting
            to the study pharmacies.

            <h3>Screening and eligibility criteria</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Interested smokers meet with the study pharmacists. The study pharmacists use a scripted
            questionnaire to screen smokers in order to assess their eligibility for the study.
            Eligible participants are patients aged 18 years and older who currently smoke one
            or more cigarettes daily for 7 days, are motivated to quit, i.e., in the preparation
            stage of the stage-of-change model, able to communicate in Arabic or English, and
            are willing to and capable of attending the scheduled sessions at the study pharmacies.
            The motivation to quit is determined by the pharmacist using the transtheoretical
            model of behavior change 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">44</span>
            </span>. Smokers in the precontemplation or contemplation stages are advised to quit, are
            provided with educational materials regarding tobacco cessation and the health benefits
            of quitting, and are encouraged to come back to the pharmacy when they feel they are
            ready to commit to quitting smoking.
         </p>
         <p>Exclusion criteria are (1) use of other nicotine or tobacco products and (2) current
            use or use in the last 30 days of smoking cessation aids or medications, (3) planning
            to leave Qatar in the next 12 months, (4) presence of any major medical condition
            that would prevent use of the nicotine replacement therapy including hypersensitivity
            to the products, history of or recent myocardial infarction, life-threatening arrhythmias,
            severe or worsening angina, uncontrolled hypertension and temporomandibular joint
            disease (in case of nicotine gum), (5) pregnancy and (6) psychiatric illness or another
            debilitating condition that would interfere with participation in the study.

            <h3>Study enrollment</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Following the completion of the screening procedure, the study pharmacist gives the
            eligible participant pertinent background information on the program, explaining what
            his or her participation would involve (including potential benefits, risks, inconveniences,
            discomforts), and his or her right to confidentiality. In order to enroll in the study,
            the interested participant is asked to sign an approved consent form. Once the consent
            form is signed, the pharmacist collects the participant’s contact information and
            sets an appointment with him or her at a date and time that is suitable for both of
            them.

            <h3>Initial appointment and randomization</h3>
         </div>
         <p>One to two days before his or her scheduled appointment, the study pharmacist contacts
            the enrolled participant to remind him or her about the appointment. At this initial
            appointment, which takes around 30 min, the study pharmacist first collects the participant’s
            sociodemographic characteristics, current medical problems and medications, smoking
            history (i.e., number of cigarettes per day, duration of smoking, previous quit attempts,
            smoking habits of other family members and the participant’s reasons for wanting to
            quit smoking) and vital signs (i.e., blood pressure and pulse). In addition, the pharmacist
            assesses the smoker’s level of nicotine dependence using the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine
            Dependence and measures his or her baseline exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) level using
            the exhaled CO test. Furthermore, the pharmacist administers the smoking cessation
            quality-of-life (SCQOL) questionnaires. After baseline data collection, the smoker
            is randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. Randomization
            is already anonymously preset by the study statistician for each study pharmacist.
            According to the participant number and the preset list, the participant will be randomized
            to the intervention or control group. A new appointment is set with the participants
            assigned to the intervention group. Participants assigned to the control group receive
            brief unstructured smoking cessation advice as outlined below. Participants in both
            groups do not pay for their participation.

               <h4>First session</h4>
            </div>
            <p>The first session is time-intensive, taking around 30 min. In this session, the study
               pharmacist facilitates the participant’s preparation to quit. The participant selects
               a quit date within the next 2-4 weeks. Based on the transtheoretical model of change,
               this would give him or her time to get prepared to enter the action stage on the quit
               date.
            </p>
            <p>The pharmacist discusses the benefits of smoking cessation with the participant and
               provides him or her with tailored behavioral and lifestyle strategies. These strategies
               take into consideration the participant behaviors, values and beliefs. For example,
               if the smoker states that the hardest time would be at work when others are taking
               breaks to smoke, the pharmacist may suggest ways to spend the time during breaks.
               As outlined under the training section, the pharmacist also provides the participant
               with information about what to expect during the quit attempt with suggestions to
               cope with the early days of quitting. In addition, the pharmacist encourages the participant
               to seek family support during the attempt.
            </p>
            <p>To prevent nicotine withdrawal symptoms, the participant is also offered, without
               cost, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) as a patch or lozenge depending on his or
               her previous experience, preference and adverse effect profile. Other NRT dosage forms,
               e.g., an inhaler, nasal spray and sublingual tablets, are not available in Qatar.
               The gum is usually not tolerated by patients. The participant is not offered the other
               smoking cessation aids, including bupropion and varenicline, as they require a prescription
               in order to be dispensed in Qatar. Before dispensing the NRT, the study pharmacist
               ensures that the participant does not have any contraindications to nicotine therapy
               and is not taking any medication that would interact with NRT. The NRT is started
               on the participant’s intended quit date. Patient counseling about NRT is provided
               to each participant regarding the dosage, administration, scheduling, duration of
               therapy, adverse effects, interactions and proper disposal.
            </p>
            <p>Participants who take the nicotine patch start at 21 mg if they smoke ten cigarettes
               or more per day. Otherwise, they receive a 14-mg patch. Both patches are continued
               for 6 weeks before being tapered. The 21-mg patch is decreased to 14 mg, continued
               for 2 weeks and decreased to 7 mg for a final 2 weeks. Patients who start with the
               14-mg patch are tapered to 7 mg for a final 2 weeks 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">45</span>
               </span>. Participants who take the nicotine lozenge use the 1-mg pieces. It is continued
               for 6 weeks as one lozenge every 1-2 h before being tapered. Then the participant
               takes one lozenge every 2-4 h for weeks 7 to 9, then one lozenge every 4-8 h for week
               10-12

            <p>A personalized action plan is created by the pharmacist to document the participant’s

               and takes around 20 min. In this session, the pharmacist determines the participant’s
               smoking status, measures his or her blood pressure/pulse/exhaled CO level, and assesses
               the NRT tolerability. If the patient succeeds in quitting, the pharmacist provides
               reinforcement and addresses problems associated with quitting such as managing withdrawal
               symptoms, coping with cravings, relieving stress, and managing fear of weight gain
               and of change in relationships with other smoking friends or relatives. If the participant
               fails to quit smoking, the pharmacist carefully reviews the participant’s experience
               during the attempt to quit and works through the identified problems. If the participant
               does not tolerate the NRT side effects (e.g., his or her blood pressure or heart rate
               increases), the pharmacist asks the participant to stop the NRT and refers him or
               her to the HMC smoking cessation clinic for further smoking cessation support. This
               participant is no longer enrolled in the study.
            </p>
            <p>The second follow-up session is scheduled 2 weeks after the first follow-up session.
               The third follow-up session is set at 4 weeks after the second follow-up session.
               These sessions take no more than 10 or 15 min each. In these sessions the pharmacist
               assesses the participant’s smoking status, blood pressure/heart rate/exhaled CO level
               and NRT tolerability and provides NRT refills. In addition, he or she focuses on maintenance
               of smoking abstinence with cognitive-behavioral strategies to prevent relapse. The
               pharmacist documents any action taken by him/her at each follow-up session. After
               the third follow-up session, all participants are instructed to call or visit the
               pharmacy for questions or to receive additional support as needed. For more information

            </div>
            <p>Participants in the control group receive 5-10 min of unstructured brief smoking cessation
               counseling by the pharmacist (emulating current practice). In addition, they are provided
               with educational materials about smoking cessation and are offered nicotine replacement
               therapy (NRT). Before dispensing the NRT, the study pharmacist ensures that the participant
               does not have any contraindications to nicotine therapy and is not taking any medication
               that would interact with NRT. The choice of the NRT dosage form (patch or lozenge)
               depends on the participant’s previous experience, preference and adverse effect profile.
               The NRT dosage schedule and duration of therapy are similar to those in the intervention
               group. Control participants are not asked to attend any follow-up sessions.
            </p>
            <p>The education materials address the following topics: the adverse effects of smoking,
               benefits of smoking cessation, the methods of quitting, setting the quit date, coping
               with nicotine withdrawal symptoms, getting emotional and social support, and monitoring
               the blood pressure and pulse when using NRT and avoiding relapse.
            </p>
            <p>The study team invests a good deal of time orienting the study pharmacists on their
               role and training them on how to deal with the control and intervention groups. Part
               of that orientation is on how ‘not’ to provide any intervention to the control subset
               of smokers.

            <h3>Study piloting</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Study pharmacists were provided with assistance in setting up the study pharmacies
            and given some time to familiarize themselves with the study protocol prior to commencement
            of the study. Then each pharmacist was asked to pilot the study in the presence of
            the study team. Piloting occurred by screening/recruiting around four patients in
            each site and by implementing the study protocol. Feedback was provided as required
            to the study pharmacists on the quality of patient counseling, patient education and
            documentation. Very minor adjustments or refinements were made to the study protocol
            and study tools including the patient consent form, Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence
            (FTND) and smoking cessation quality-of-life (SCQOL) questionnaire as needed.

         </div>
         <p>At all stages of the study implementation, the study pharmacists are closely supervised
            by the study team. Supervision is through several mechanisms including meetings, communication
            and site visits.

            <p>Regular meetings are invaluable for high-quality supervision. Meetings are used to
               guide the project toward its objectives through team involvement. Bi- or triweekly
               meetings involving all the team members including the study pharmacists are held.
               In these meetings, study harmacists summarize their activities during the previous
               2-3 weeks, and the study team offers them constructive feedback, acknowledges their
               input and suggests new directions to them. In addition, ad-hoc meetings are conducted
               between the study pharmacists and the study team where necessary to address any irregular
               issues that might arise.

            <h3>Overview of utilization cost</h3>
         </div>
         <p>A comparative overview of the cost of resource utilization (economic analysis) will
            be undertaken for the study arms in this study.
         </p>
         <div id="">
            <div tagx="st">
               <h4>Model inputs and cost determination</h4>
            </div>
            <p>This pharmacoeconomic analysis will be based on extrapolating data on resources from
               the randomized controlled trial; these data will be collected prospectively. Prospective
               data collection enhances the accuracy and robustness of data and limits bias.
            </p>
            <p>The economic analysis is performed from a social perspective. Direct medical costs
               will be evaluated to the best available, including in relation to NRT, CO monitoring
               tests and salaries. Direct nonmedical costs will also be evaluated and will include
               participants’ travel costs to pharmacies (e.g., taxi) and the paperwork and forms.
               The indirect costs will be accounted for as well, in relation to lost productivity
               (if any), whether for participants or any unpaid caregivers that participants utilize.
               Important is that any protocol-driven costs (e.g., researchers salaries) will be excluded
               from the analysis.
            </p>
            <p>The monetary value of resources will be collected from internal sources at the Qatari
               clinics. It is worth noting that costs involved in this study will be based on wholesale
               prices, as paid by clinics.
            </p>
            <p>All calculated costs will be in Qatari Riyal, adjusted for the financial year 2015-2016,
               utilizing the Qatari Health Consumer Price Index as appropriate, and no discounts
               will be applied given the short timeframe of the analysis.
            </p>
            <p>The economic evaluation will be undertaken via decision analytic modeling, where a
               decision tree will be structured to follow the different options and consequences
               in the management pathways. For each of the participants, the proposed model may include
               five possible treatment outcomes depending on whether participants quit smoking, and
               if they do, after what duration. Smokers will be initially assigned to one of two
               pathways depending on whether they quit smoking at enrollment. Smokers who do not
               quit at enrollment will be further followed until assigned to one of two pathways,
               depending on whether the smoker quits smoking after 3 months or not. If not, smokers
               will be followed up until further assigned to one of two pathways, based on whether
               they quit smoking after 6 months or not. Those who do not quit by then will be followed
               up until assigned to one of two pathways depending on whether they quit at 12 months
               of follow-up or not, which will be the end of follow-up in any case. Smokers who quit
               at enrollment or after 3, 6 or 12 months will each be followed up separately until
               the end of the study. Based on this, in addition to data on resources consumed and
               their monetary values, the model will generate a weighted average cost for patient
               cessation and quality-of-life adjustment. As per the general decision analysis principles,
               this will be calculated as the sum-product of the costs of the management outcomes
               and the respective probabilities.
            </p>
            <p>The costs of managing the single episode of smoking cessation will be compared among
               different management options and against budgeted costs of clinics/government institutions.

               <h4>Sensitivity analysis</h4>
            </div>
            <p>The goal of sensitivity analysis is to indicate the robustness of the evaluation conclusion
               against any potential variations in the model inputs. Deterministic and probabilistic
               sensitivity tests will be produced by modifications on the base case values of several
               key variables, in relevance to costs and probabilities, to evaluate the robustness
               of the study economic outcome. Base case values will be substituted by the highest
               and lowest values within a reasonable range of values. Where a substitution changes
               the study economic conclusion, more values within the range will replace the base
               case value. This will be repeated until the exact variable value that changes the
               study outcome is identified. Reporting this as part of the study results not only
               indicates the robustness of results, but also boosts the generalizability of them
               when being interpreted by decision makers in other settings, with different model
               inputs, e.g., different resource prices.
            </p>
            <p>Uncertainty analysis, by means of Monte Carlo simulation, will be performed via the
               @Risk-5.0® analysis tool (Palisade Corp., NY, USA) to investigate the likelihood (probability)
               of a therapy’s economic advantage. Monte Carlo is a method whereby simulated input
               values, chosen randomly across a range of probability distributions of a model input,
               are added into the model. The model is run for each simulated input, resulting in
               a range of outputs characterizing the output uncertainty. Based on this, a distribution
               of “cost savings” will be generated, indicating the probability of one management
               option to have an economic advantage over another.

         </p>
         <p>They will measure the following outcome variables at 3, 6 and 12 months after the
            start of the study (i.e., the time of the participant’s enrollment in the study):
         </p>
         <p> Self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence, defined as having smoked no cigarettes
            for the previous 7 days at 3, 6 and 12 months
         </p>
         <p> Self-reported 30-day point prevalence abstinence defined as having smoked no cigarettes
            in the last 30 days at 3, 6 and 12 months
         </p>
         <p> Self-reported continuous abstinence defined as having smoked no cigarettes since
            quit day at 3, 6 and 12 months
         </p>
         <p> Smoking abstinence as objectively verified by the CO exhaled test at 12 months</p>
         <p> Mean change in health-related quality-of-life score from baseline at 3, 6 and 12
            months for quitters vs. non-quitters
         </p>
         <p> Overall costs of interventions as studied, including those of utilization for individual
            recourses consumed
         </p>
         <p> Average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the study smoking cessation intervention</p>
         <p>To objectively determine long-term abstinence, at 12 months, participants who will
            self-report not smoking for the previous 7 days will be invited to come to their study
            clinic to measure their exhaled CO level. The clinic nurse who is responsible for
            measuring the exhaled CO level will be blinded to the study participant group. Participants
            will be considered abstinent if they register less than 6 ppm on the test. Interpretation
            of the CO test results will be made carefully taking into consideration time since
            last smoke, time of the day the test is done and other factors.
         </p>
         <p>Exhaled carbon monoxide is a well-known indicator of cigarette smoking. But because
            of its short half-life (5-6 h), it only indicates very recent smoking exposure or
            abstinence. On the other hand, as a result of its relatively long half-life, cotinine
            can detect nicotine exposure for up to 1 week. However, the use of any NRT formulation
            can trigger a false-positive urinary cotinine test. Therefore, as it is not expensive
            and is noninvasive, and it gives the results in a timely manner, the exhaled carbon
            monoxide test is commonly used in most smoking cessation clinical trials

            <h3>Data analysis</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The CONSORT guidelines will be followed when analyzing the study data. Demographics
            and other variables related to smoking and quality of life will be summarized using
            frequency distributions (for categorical variables) and means with standard deviations
            (for numeric variables) and will be compared between the two study arms using the
            chi-squared test (or alternatively the Fisher’s exact test for small cell counts)
            for categorical variables and the independent 
            <i>t</i>-test (or alternatively the Wilcoxon rank sum test for non-normally distributed variables)
            for numerical variables.
         </p>
         <p>The main outcome will be continuous abstinence at 12 months as self-reported and verified
            by the CO test. The percentages of participants achieving the main outcome will be
            computed and compared between the two groups using the chi-squared test. Moreover,
            the difference in the proportions of continuous abstinence at 12 months between the
            two study arms (with 95% confidence intervals) will be computed along with the number
            needed to treat. Multiple logistic regression will be used to obtain the odds ratio
            of the main outcome between the two study arms adjusting for any imbalances in demographics
            or other baseline smoking-related variables. Moreover, mixed effects logistic regression,
            with pharmacy-level random effect, will be considered to adjust for the possible pharmacy
            effect if it existed. The intent-to-treat principal will be used in the analysis whereby
            participants who will be lost to follow-up will be classified as smokers and included
            in the main analysis. This includes those who were removed from the study because
            they could not tolerate NRT side effects. A sensitivity analysis following that of
            Borelli, Hogan et al. will be done where the outcome has three possible categories:
            abstinence, no abstinence and dropout 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">48</span>
            </span>. The suggested multinomial model will allow assessing factors affecting abstinence
            as well as factors affecting dropout. This will aid in understanding who might need
            more support during the intervention. Similar analyses for the primary outcome will
            be done at 3 and 6 months (but do not include verification of abstinence using CO
            tests).
         </p>
         <p>To assess the participants’ health-related quality of life, SCQOL (smoking cessation
            quality of life) ratings for each question will be translated into scores. A total
            health-related quality of life score and a domain-specific score will be calculated
            at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months for each participant in the intervention
            and control groups. The change in the total and domain-specific quality-of-life score
            from baseline will be calculated for each participant at 3, 6 and 12 months and analyzed

         </div>
         <p>For a priori sample size calculation, we assumed a 7-day point prevalence abstinence
            at 12 months of 3% for the control group and 15% for the intervention group based
            on the results of one of the previous studies that assessed the effect of a pharmacist-run
            smoking cessation program 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
            </span>. With a two-sided alpha of 5% and 90% power, a minimum sample size of 118 participants
            was estimated for each group. This sample size was not adjusted for the potential
            correlation between outcomes of patients within each clinic since this is not a clustered
            randomized clinical trial, but in this study patients within each clinic are randomized
            to the two intervention groups, and correlations, if they exist, will be very small;
            their effect on the power of the study is negligible 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">15</span>
            </span>. The project has a total of 17 study pharmacists. Each study site is expected to
            enroll at least 30 participants (15 participants in the intervention group and 15
            participants in the control group). The recruitment period is over 12 months (48 weeks).
            Recruiting at least 30 participants at each study site is considered feasible given
            that at least 100 patients visit each pharmacy per day. Assuming each study site will
            recruit 1 participant every week, the 30 needed participants will be recruited in
            30 weeks (approximately 8 months). An extra 16 weeks of recruitment time is given
            to study pharmacists to account for workload, holidays and sickness.

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>This study is the first randomized controlled trial conducted within Qatar and the
         Middle East (ME) to test the effect of a pharmacist-delivered smoking cessation program
         on smoking cessation rates. Furthermore, it is the first study in Qatar to assess
         the change in health-related quality of life after quitting smoking.
      </p>
      <p>Having the economic analysis component in this study is also of unique significance.
         To our knowledge, there are no economic studies that have evaluated the economics
         of a smoking cessation program in Qatar or the region. This component is important
         as in settings where resources are scarce, proving that an intervention brings a good
         return to the investment can be as important as proving the intervention effective.
      </p>
      <p>Indeed, in consideration of limited resources and tight departmental budgets, the
         additional spending associated with any of the study options should be examined. This
         will be performed through determining the management option that yields benefits that
         are associated with most health costs savings. For example, the structured program
         in this study is expected to have a favorable comparative effect profile. But if the
         value that is associated with these advantages is not high enough, having the structured
         program in settings may not be the priority practice to implement. Here, the current
         study provides a great opportunity for such analysis, seeing that randomized controlled
         trials are the ideal source of data (i.e., highest level evidence) to be used in the
         construction of economic analyses.
      </p>
      <p>This study will be of significance to Qatar, the ME and to some extent the world.
         It will advance knowledge about the role that the ambulatory pharmacists in Qatar
         and possibly in the ME can play in smoking cessation. It will show to what extent
         these pharmacists would be effective in helping smokers quit smoking. This would be
         important for Qatar and the ME given the high number of cigarette smokers in these
         countries 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">49</span>
         </span>. This study will also help in comparing the effect of pharmacist-delivered smoking
         cessation programs in Qatar with the effect of pharmacist-delivered smoking cessation
         programs in other countries. Many previous studies conducted in Australia, Europe
         and the USA have demonstrated the effectiveness of pharmacist-run smoking cessation
         programs 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
         </span>. Extrapolating the results of these studies to Qatar and the ME is not readily applicable.
         The pharmacy practice environment in these countries differs from that in Qatar. The
         pace of improvement in ambulatory pharmacy practice in Qatar, as other ME countries,
         is slow. Except for a few cognitive and patient-oriented activities, ambulatory pharmacists’
         job is limited to prescription processing and medication dispensing 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">50</span>
         </span>. Nevertheless, Qatar’s pharmacists are increasingly interested in defining a well-recognized
         vocation for themselves in today’s healthcare system and in moving their focus from
         pharmaceutical products to patients. This study will be of potential significance
         to ambulatory pharmacists in Qatar. It will put them in a broader perspective than
         the product-dispensing context. It will promote their role as public health educators
         and accessible sources of health information. Ambulatory pharmacists are an essential
         part of the healthcare system in Qatar and are an existing workforce that needs to
         be given the opportunity to contribute to patient care. By direct involvement of these
         pharmacists in smoking cessation, this study will help in improving their professional
         role and in shifting it to a more patient-centered focus and will assist them in having
         better integration into the healthcare team in Qatar.
