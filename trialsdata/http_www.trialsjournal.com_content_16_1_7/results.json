      "Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to a profound muscular atrophy, bone loss and bone fragility. While there is evidence that exercising paralysed muscles may lead to reversal of muscle atrophy in the chronic period after SCI, there is little evidence that exercise can prevent muscle changes early after injury. Moreover, whether exercise can prevent bone loss and microarchitectural decay is not clear."
