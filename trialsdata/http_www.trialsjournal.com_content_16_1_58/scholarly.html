               </div>
               <p>Treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) consists of chemoradiation therapy
                  (CRT) and surgery. Approximately 15% of patients show a pathological complete response
                  (pCR). Increased pCR-rates can be achieved through dose escalation, thereby increasing
                  the number patients eligible for organ-preservation to improve quality of life (QoL).
                  A randomized comparison of 65 versus 50Gy with external-beam radiation alone has not
                  yet been performed. This trial investigates pCR rate, clinical response, toxicity,
                  QoL and (disease-free) survival in LARC patients treated with 65Gy (boost + chemoradiation)
                  compared with 50Gy standard chemoradiation (sCRT).

                  <h3>Methods/design</h3>
               </div>
               <p>This study follows the ‘cohort multiple randomized controlled trial’ (cmRCT) design:
                  rectal cancer patients are included in a prospective cohort that registers clinical
                  baseline, follow-up, survival and QoL data. At enrollment, patients are asked consent
                  to offer them experimental interventions in the future. Eligible patients—histologically
                  confirmed LARC (T3NxM0 &lt;1 mm from mesorectal fascia, T4NxM0 or TxN2M0) located ≤10
                  cm from the anorectal transition who provided consent for  experimental intervention
                  offers—form a subcohort (
                  <i>n</i> = 120). From this subcohort, a random sample is offered the boost prior to sCRT (
                  <i>n</i> = 60), which they may accept or refuse. Informed consent is signed only after acceptance
                  of the boost. Non-selected patients in the subcohort (
                  <i>n</i> = 60) undergo sCRT alone and are not notified that they participate in the control
                  arm until the trial is completed.
               </p>
               <p>sCRT consists of 50Gy (25 × 2Gy) with concomitant capecitabine. The boost (without
                  chemotherapy) is given prior to sCRT and consists of 15 Gy (5 × 3Gy) delivered to
                  the gross tumor volume (GTV). The primary endpoint is pCR (TRG 1). Secondary endpoints
                  include acute grade 3–4 toxicity, good pathologic response (TRG 1-2), clinical response,
                  surgical complications, QoL and (disease-free) survival. Data is analyzed by intention
                  to treat.

               </div>
               <p>The boost is delivered prior to sCRT so that GTV adjustment for tumor shrinkage during
                  sCRT is not necessary. Small margins also aim to limit irradiation of healthy tissue.
                  The cmRCT design provides opportunity to overcome common shortcomings of classic RCTs,
                  such as slow recruitment, disappointment-bias in control arm patients and poor generalizability.

         </span>. Rectal cancers are treated by surgery, preceded by chemoradiation in case of locally
         advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Chemoradiation consists of a total dose of about 50 Gy
         combined with capecitabine. With this treatment regimen, approximately 15% of patients
         show a pathological complete response (pCR) 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>. In a recent meta-analysis, we showed that doses of ≥60 Gy were associated with an

      <p>Patients with ‘good’ clinical response, either pCR (TRG 1) or near-pCR (TRG 2), might
         be eligible for organ-preserving approaches. The aim of these strategies is to deliver
         an optimal quality of life (QoL) without compromising the oncologic outcome in this
         favorable subgroup. Recently, several protocols have been developed, that use either
         local excision 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span> or a “watch-and-wait” policy 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span>, in order to omit surgery (total mesorectal excision) as the primary treatment. In
         addition, patients who reach a pCR often show reduced local recurrence and improved
         (disease-free) survival probabilities compared with patients with a poor response
         (TRG 3–5) 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">15</span>
         </span>, possibly driven by a favorable tumor biology.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, by escalating the preoperative radiation dose, the amount of patients with a
         ‘good’ clinical response or pCR who are eligible for organ-preserving treatment can
         potentially be increased. However, response rates after high-dose external radiation
         with 65 Gy have not yet been investigated in a randomized setting. Therefore, we set
         up an exploratory trial, the RandomizEd Controlled Trial for Pre-operAtive Dose-escaLation
         BOOST in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer (RECTAL BOOST study: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01951521)
         to compare tumor pCR rates (TRG 1), pathologic ‘good’ responses, toxicity levels,
         clinical tumor response and QoL between patients treated with 65 Gy chemoradiation
         (15 Gy boost plus 50 Gy chemoradiation) and those treated with 50 Gy standard chemoradiation
         therapy (sCRT).

         </div>
         <p>sCRT consists of 50 Gy (25 × 2 Gy on weekdays) combined with capecitabine. The radiation
            dose is delivered by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), which is standard
            care in our hospital, to the planned target volume (PTV), which comprises the gross
            tumor volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV). Target volumes are delineated
            on computed tomography (CT) scans, matched to- and combined with T2- and diffusion-weighted
            magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) according to published guidelines 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
            </span>. The CTV follows the mesorectal fascia up to the rectosigmoid curvature and stretches
            maximally to 4 cm caudal from the tumor, sparing the sphincter in case of a low anterior
            resection (LAR), or includes the sphincter complex +1-cm margin in case of an abdominoperineal
            resection (APR). The lymph node regions (internal iliac and obturator) stretch from
            the caudal end of the v. iliaca communis downward to the crossing of the internal
            iliac vessels under the m. piriformis, laterally limited by the pelvic muscles. The
            obturator region stretches from the m. obturatorius to the m. levator, ventrally limited
            by the ureter or dorsal side of the neurovascular bundle without inclusion of the
            vesiculae, uterus and vagina. Lateral and dorsal border are marked by the pelvic muscles
            and ventral iliac region. In addition, the presacral region stretches from the upper
            level of the iliac vessels to mesorectum, ventrally limited 2 cm from the sacrum,
            including the a. rectalis superior and excluding the neuroforamina. The PTV
            <sub>CTV50</sub> is a non-uniform margin around the CTV according to local protocol consisting of
            an expansion of 13 mm ventrally, 9 mm dorsally, 10 mm laterally and 10 mm craniocaudally
            (Figure 
            <div tagx="figr">2</div>). The prescribed dose to the PTV
            <sub>CTV50</sub> is that 95% of the prescribed dose should cover ≥99% of the PTV. Radiation is delivered
            with an external beam linear accelerator. For position verification, the sCRT protocol
            consists of cone-beam CT prior to the first three fractions and weekly thereafter.

            <h3>Boost intervention</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The experimental boost intervention consists of 15 Gy (5 × 3 Gy on weekdays) to the
            GTV without concomitant chemotherapy. The boost is delivered in the week prior to
            the start of sCRT. A cumulative GTV dose of 65 Gy is delivered over the full treatment
            course of 30 fractions (6 weeks). This results in an equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions
            of 66.3 Gy (α/β = 10 Gy) 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">23</span>
            </span>. GTV delineation is based on T2-weighted and DWI scans; no CTV
            <sub>GTV65</sub> margin is applied; and the PTV
            <sub>GTV65</sub> is defined by a non-uniform margin of +11 mm in the anteroposterior direction, +7 mm
            in the lateral direction and +13 mm in the craniocaudal direction around the GTV,
            which represents tumor movement that was observed on in-house daily MRI scans and

            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">24</span>
            </span>. A volumetric modulated arc therapy stereotactic treatment plan is generated for
            boost patients, whereas IMRT is standard care used in the control arm, that accumulates
            the boost and standard chemoradiation doses (Figure 
            <div tagx="figr">2</div>). The maximally allowed cumulative dose within the GTV is 80 Gy (123% of 65 Gy),
            and the volume receiving 95% of the prescribed dose should be larger than 99% of the
            PTV
            <sub>GTV65</sub>. The maximum dose around, and dose prescription to, the PTV
            <sub>CTV50</sub> is similar to the elective sCRT field (that is, 53.5 Gy). Daily online cone-beam
            CT scans are used for positioning before each boost fraction, and the sCRT position
            verification protocol follows thereafter.
         </p>
         <p>Organs at risk (OARs) consist of the bowel bag (excluding sigmoid), bladder, vagina
            and anal sphincter. The dose constraints for the OARs remain unchanged for boost patients
            (namely, the dose to 1 cc of the OARs should be ≤53.5 Gy), and the volume receiving
            45 Gy is aimed to be less than 195 cc for the bowel bag (excluding the sigmoid). OAR
            constraints are leading over PTV
            <sub>GTV65</sub> coverage and may thus limit GTV dose if necessary. If dose prescriptions cannot be
            reached, a panel of radiation oncologists will discuss the feasibility and anticipated
            safety of the treatment plan and decide either to continue or to adapt the plan toward
            acceptable OAR constraints, taking into account anatomical limitations and planned
            surgery. One additional MRI scan is obtained in patients who receive the boost for
            response prediction purposes at the end of the second week (after ten fractions including
            the five boost fractions) and a rectoscopy for clinical response evaluation is performed
            in a subgroup of boost-arm patients that showed a ‘good’ response based on MRI.

            1–2) or ‘not good’ (TRG 3–5) by the pathologist. A radiation oncologist will assess
            toxicity at weekly visits during the radiation treatment, as well as 4 weeks and 4 months
            after completion of sCRT. Toxicity is recorded according to the National Cancer Institute’s
            Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">26</span>
            </span>. Long-term toxicity, (serious) adverse events (SAEs), hospitalization and other health-related
            problems are registered within the context of the PICNIC cohort during clinical follow-up
            and annual patient-administered questionnaires on health and oncological status. Clinical
            response evaluation is based on MRI (9 weeks after completion of chemoradiation; that
            is, the week before surgery) and DRE and rectoscopy, which are both performed right
            before surgery while the patient is under anesthesia. MRI and DRE are standardly performed
            in all patients, whereas rectoscopy is only performed in intervention arm patients
            who showed a good response based on MRI. For the MRI, a combination of T2-weighted
            and DWI sequences is used to measure residual tumor tissue in the initially delineated
            tumor region and its surrounding elective radiation field. Surgical complications
            are registered up to 30 days after the primary surgery in all patients and after closure
            of the diverting stoma in patients who previously underwent a LAR. For safety reasons,
            occurrence of anastomotic leakage is monitored closely in the LAR subgroup by daily
            review of postoperative patient charts for 30 days. QoL data are recorded by means
            of either online forms (Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Initial treatment and

            from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) are used,
            including the core (QLQ-C30 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">

               <span tagx="abbr">29</span>
            </span>) questionnaires. The EORTC QLQ-C30 covers five functional scales, three symptom scales,
            a global QoL scale and six single items. The EORTC QLQ-CR29 assesses urinary, bowel
            and/or stoma, psychological and sexually related QoL issues, as well as side effects
            due to chemotherapy. These questionnaires are provided at the time of diagnosis (baseline)
            and 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months thereafter. Survival and disease-free survival are
            monitored within the PICNIC project through clinical follow-up records and via a link
            with the Dutch Cancer Registry. Disease-free survival is defined as the time in absence
            of a rectal cancer local recurrence or metastasis.

         <p>According to Dutch law, the investigator reports SAEs within 15 days following notification

            (Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects):

            that result in death or are life-threatening will be reported within 7 days.
         </p>
         <p>Because this is an exploratory dose escalation study, an independent data and safety
            monitoring board (DSMB) will make recommendations on continuation of the study based
            on safety results, focusing on toxicity and anastomotic leakage. The DSMB consists
            of an expert surgeon, a radiation oncologist and a statistician and is provided, annually
            or after every SAE, with the raw data on the primary and secondary outcomes (including
            toxicity, surgical complications and survival). After the first 10 patients with LAR
            have undergone boost treatment, inclusion of patients scheduled for LAR will be stopped
            for 8 months to let the DSMB compare anastomotic leakages between boost and control
            arms. The 8-month period will consist of the time between sCRT to primary surgery
            (10–12 weeks) followed by the time between primary surgery and bowel reconstruction,
            including a postoperative monitoring period (16–20 weeks). Only inclusion of patients
            undergoing LAR will be halted during this stop, because patients undergoing APR have
            no risk of anastomotic leakage, owing to their permanent stoma. The DSMB analyzes
            the data independently of the investigators and reports their advice on continuation
            of the study to the sponsor, which will decide on continuation or stopping of the
            study.

            <h3>Sample size considerations</h3>
         </div>
         <p>On the basis of our center’s experience, we assume that 13% of patients will reach
            pCR if undergoing sCRT. On the basis of a prediction model published by Appelt 
            <i>et al.</i>
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">30</span>
            </span>, we expect the pCR rate to be 30% after 65 Gy treatment. Because we consider this
            study to constitute preliminary work for subsequent studies aimed at evaluating even
            higher dose increases, we deem it important to find an effect if there really is one,
            but less important to unjustly find an effect. Therefore, we will use a one-sided
            α of 15% because it is unlikely that the pCR rate after boost treatment plus sCRT
            will be lower than after sCRT alone, in combination with a power of 80% because we
            do not want to increase uncertainty when a negative result is achieved. We further
            expect that approximately 80% of the patients who receive a boost offer will accept
            it. Patients who are offered the boost treatment but refuse to undergo the boost will
            remain in the intervention arm for analysis but receive sCRT (Figure 
            <div tagx="figr">1</div>). We expect no cross-over from the control arm to the intervention arm, because only
            patients who are randomly selected to receive a boost offer are informed about and
            offered it, whereas all non-selected patients undergo standard treatment (that is,
            sCRT) without receiving information about the boost trial. Taking into account the
            estimated response rates, together with a 20% refusal rate in the intervention arm,
            we require 60 patients per arm to demonstrate a statistically significant difference.
            We expect to complete recruitment within 3 years.

            eligible patients who were not randomly selected (control arm). In case of dropout

            responders and all non-resected control patients are classified as complete responders.
            However, because omission of surgery is not common practice in our institution, we
            expect these numbers to be small. In case of substantial boost treatment refusal in
            the intervention arm, complier average causal effect analysis will be performed to

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The RECTAL BOOST study aims to quantify the effect of an external beam radiation (EBR)
         boost of 15 Gy prior to standard chemoradiation (50 Gy) on pCR rates in patients with
         locally advanced rectal cancer. Toxicity, clinical (complete) response, (surgical)
         complications, (disease-free) survival, QoL and feasibility of boost delivery are
         secondary endpoints. In this study, we will assess in a randomized fashion whether
         a preoperative 65 Gy EBR-only regimen (15 Gy boost followed by 50 Gy chemoradiation)
         can safely increase the proportion of patients with pCR (TRG 1) in comparison with
         the proportion observed after 50 Gy chemoradiation alone. Although contact X-ray 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">34</span>
         </span>, brachytherapy, EBR and EBR-brachytherapy combined studies 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span> have shown response, sphincter-saving and organ preservation benefits at doses up
         to 60 Gy, such benefits have not been shown for the 65 Gy dose level when reached
         by an EBR-only approach.
      </p>
      <p>High rates of good responders are important, as this will increase the number of patients
         eligible for organ-preserving treatment strategies. These strategies aim to improve
         the QoL of patients with a good response while their good oncologic outcome, and possible
         survival benefits, are maintained. Nevertheless, the value of tumor regression has
         not yet been confirmed as a surrogate endpoint for oncologic outcome in this setting.
         In the present study, however, all patients, including those with a good clinical
         response to preoperative treatment, will still undergo surgery because pathological
         response is the primary endpoint, and because resection remains the standard care
         according to Dutch guidelines 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
         </span>. Therefore, future randomized studies in patients with good clinical responses after
         (boost) chemoradiation are needed to further assess the effect of radical surgery
         versus organ preservation on QoL, toxicity and (disease-free) survival. In this study,
         we aim to quantify response rate by its current gold standard (that is, pathology),
         which in turn can be correlated to the clinical response data that are also obtained.
         In so doing, this study will provide important insight into the results of dose escalation
         that would otherwise be lacking in a trial that would combine dose escalation and
         omission of surgery within the same trial.
      </p>
      <p>In this study, we choose to deliver the boost prior to chemoradiation to obtain maximal
         tumor visibility in order to avoid dose administration to healthy tissue. The rationale
         underlying this is that GTV deformation is likely to occur during sCRT as a result
         of tumor shrinkage, and because the induced inflammatory reaction results in edema
         which hinders adequate GTV definition. Both factors make imaging and delineation of
         the tumor more difficult and less reliable  thereby likely to result in overestimation
         of the remaining GTV. When larger areas would then incorrectly be irradiated, surrounding
         healthy tissue might receive a higher dose than planned. On the basis of our own data
         on patients receiving 5 × 5 Gy radiation within one week, we know that tumor shrinkage
         does not yet occur during the first week of radiation, which implies that GTV delineations
         made prior to irradiation remain adequate throughout the first week of (chemo)radiation.
         This allows a single GTV delineation to be used for boost dose planning in the week
         prior to sCRT. Furthermore, we choose to use IMRT because this is the standard of
         care in our hospital, and this study is set up as a single-facility trial. Direct
         applicability of these results should thus be considered when extrapolated to other
         centers in which different radiation techniques are used.
      </p>
      <p>We have chosen to apply the cmRCT design, which aims to overcome common shortcomings
         of classic RCTs, such as slow recruitment, disappointment bias in patients randomized
         to the control arm, and poor generalizability. Not uncommonly, oncological patients
         possess strong preferences for experimental treatments that are (often) falsely regarded
         to be superior. This prevents such patients from taking part in randomized studies,
         thereby diminishing recruitment rates for RCTs. Furthermore, patients who remain willing
         to participate in RCTs often represent a younger, healthier, higher-educated subgroup,
         and once participating, these patients are unfortunately often allowed to participate
         in only one trial at a time. All this makes recruitment for RCTs difficult and prone
         to selection bias. Because the cmRCT design uses a cohort as a recruitment pool, it
         represents the routine population more adequately because cohort inclusion is generally
         less selective. Because this baseline may also evolve over time, the cmRCT furthermore
         provides the advantage that the effectiveness of experimental interventions is compared
         with the most up-to-date available standard care with which it should compete, instead
         of competing with outdated treatments which is often the case when classic RCTs are
         published. A new aspect brought by the cmRCT design is that it provides the opportunity
         to evaluate acceptance rates of offered treatments. This offers new insights into
         patient preferences and reasons for refusal of experimental interventions that become
         increasingly important. It forces clinicians and researchers to rethink their treatment
         approach at a much earlier stage when, for instance, a large proportion of patients
         declines the offered treatment. Overall, efficient, less selective recruitment, collection
         of long-term outcomes and early preference monitoring could reduce research costs
         significantly when conducting RCTs within the cmRCT design.
      </p>
      <p>The RECTAL BOOST study is a pragmatic RCT performed within the infrastructure of the
         cmRCT design, that aims to quantify the effect on pCR rate of preoperative dose escalation
         to 65 Gy in comparison with standard 50 Gy chemoradiation in patients with locally
         advanced rectal cancer. If the proportion of good responders can be increased by dose
         escalation, this strategy could provide an option to increase the number of patients
         that may benefit from organ-preserving strategies in the future.
