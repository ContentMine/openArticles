      "Patients with RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) are more sedentary than the general population. Reduction of Sedentary Behaviour (SB) has been suggested as a mean for improvement of health in patients with chronic diseases and mobility problems. Short-term intervention studies have demonstrated that SB can be reduced by behavioural interventions in healthy populations. However, it remains unexplored whether it is valid for patients with RA also."
