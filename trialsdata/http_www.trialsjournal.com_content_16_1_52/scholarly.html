                  <h3>Background</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Based on a recent meta-analysis, a continuous suture technique with a suture to wound
                  length ratio of at least 4:1, using a slowly absorbable monofilament suture material,
                  is recommended for primary median laparotomy closure. Incisional hernia, which develops
                  in 9 to 20% of patients, remains the major complication of abdominal wall closure.
                  Current clinical data indicate that the incidence of incisional hernias increases
                  by 60% between the first and the third year after median laparotomy, implicating that
                  a follow-up period of 1 year postoperatively is too short with regard to this common
                  complication. Trauma to the abdominal wall can be reduced by improvements in suture
                  technique as well as suture material. Several factors, such as stitch length, suture
                  tension, elasticity, and tensile strength of the suture material are discussed and
                  currently under investigation. A Swedish randomized controlled trial showed a significant
                  reduction in the incisional hernia rate by shortening the stitch length. However,
                  a non-elastic thread was used and follow-up ended after 12 months. Therefore, we designed
                  a multicenter, international, double-blinded, randomized trial to analyze the influence
                  of stitch length, using an elastic, extra-long term absorbable monofilament suture,
                  on the long term clinical outcome of abdominal wall closure.

                  <h3>Methods</h3>
               </div>
               <p>In total, 468 patients undergoing an elective, median laparotomy will be randomly
                  allocated to either the short stitch or the long stitch suture technique for abdominal
                  wall closure in a 1:1 ratio. Centers located in Germany and Austria will participate.
                  The primary endpoint measure is the incisional hernia rate 1 year postoperatively,
                  as verified by ultrasound. The frequency of short term and long term complications
                  as well as costs, length of hospital stay and patients’ quality of life (EQ-5D-5 L)
                  will be considered as secondary parameters. Following hospital discharge, patients
                  will be examined after 30 days and 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery.

                  in combination with an elastic, extra-long term absorbable monofilament suture can
                  prevent incisional hernias in the long term, compared with the long stitch suture

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The risk of developing an incisional hernia after primary elective median laparotomy
         is reported in the literature as being between 9 and 20% 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. Among multiple risk factors, the malfunction or delay of collagen synthesis appears
         to be of utmost relevance. Friedman 
         <i>et al.</i>
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span> showed direct correlation between a reduced collagen I/III quotient and the development
         of an unstable scar, based on immature, less mechanically stable, collagen 1. Obesity,
         steroid therapy, malnutrition, nicotine use, and connective tissue diseases are undeniably
         further main risk factors. But how should other factors, such as closure technique,
         suture material, or surgical experience, be interpreted in this context? Despite the
         paradigm shift in hernia surgery triggered in the beginning of the 1980s, which was
         initiated with the first documented use of plastic meshes by Usher 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>, the problem of ensuring appropriate closure of the median laparotomy has not yet
         been satisfactorily solved. This issue still remains a topic of controversial discussion.
      </p>
      <p>Since the publications of the Swedish group of Leif Israelsson 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span> in 1993, the continuous closure technique with a defined suture/wound length ratio
         of 4:1 has increasingly been used 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>. For a long time, discussions regarding the ideal suture revolved around whether
         it should be ‘non- or slowly absorbable’. After numerous studies and meta-analyses
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>, conducted most recently by Diener 
         <i>et al.</i>
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>, the evidence for the ideal primary abdominal closure seem to have been adequately
         established. Based on the most recent meta-analysis of primary laparotomy closure,
         the continuous suture technique with a suture to wound length ratio of at least 4:1,
         using a monofilament, slowly absorbable suture can be considered state of the art.
      </p>
      <p>Minimization of trauma to the abdominal wall is the most important consideration in
         terms of improvement of surgical technique and suture material used. According to
         the biomechanical principles of abdominal wall tension, the distribution of suture
         tension over small tissue bridges using the appropriate needle size and suture strength
         to minimize tissue trauma is the most promising approach 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>. In addition to the surgical technique, the elasticity of the suture material is
         a further critical factor in preventing so-called ‘buttonholes’, according to physiological
         studies of the abdominal wall. Taking into account the results of experimental studies
         by Höer 
         <i>et al.</i>
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span>, the association of different closure techniques and abdominal wall perfusions leading
         to different collagen ratios seems to be crucial in terms of creating a stable scar.
      </p>
      <p>Based on these facts, the use of a monofilament suture material with a high elasticity
         in combination with a long-lasting basic retention strength as well as an extra-long
         absorption time of 390 days (MonoMax®, B. Braun Surgical SA, Rubi, Spain) seems to
         bear a significant potential for the improvement of abdominal wall suture stability
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span>. This suture material might further improve the promising results of Millbourn’s
         randomized controlled trial 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span> and will, therefore, by used in our multicenter, randomized controlled trial, which
         is aimed at comparing the long term clinical outcome of small versus large bite closure
         techniques after primary median laparotomies.

         <p>The Effect of Suture Technique on the Occurrence of Incisional Hernia (ESTOIH) study
            is a prospective, international, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled
            trial, aimed at evaluating the efficacy of the short stitch suture technique using
            an elastic, extra-long term absorbable monofilament suture (MonoMax®) after primary
            median laparotomy, in comparison with the long stitch suture technique.
         </p>
         <p>In total, 468 patients will be enrolled in seven centers located in Germany and Austria.
            Patients will be randomly allocated to receive either the short or the long stitch
            suture technique for abdominal wall closure in a 1:1 ratio. The surgical procedure
            used to close the abdomen will be standardized in both suture technique groups and
            the participating centers will be trained in the different suture techniques.
         </p>
         <p>After the operative procedure, the investigator will examine the patients on the second
            day after surgery, on the day of discharge, and at 30 days ±10 days, 1 year ±1 month,
            3 years ±3 months and 5 years ±3 months postoperatively. Patients and observers performing
            the follow-up visits will be unaware of the suture technique (double-blinded) used.

            and with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status of I to III are eligible
            for this trial. After approval of the study protocol by the local ethics committee,
            patients will be screened consecutively for possible eligibility in the participating
            centers. All patients who seem to meet the in- and exclusion criteria will be asked
            whether they are willing to participate in the ESTOIH study and will be informed about
            the purpose of the trial. Written informed consent has to be obtained from each enrolled
            patient before the operation.

            <h3>Randomization</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to receive either the short or the long
            stitch suture technique in a 1:1 ratio by opening a sealed opaque envelope. Envelopes
            are supplied by the sponsor, according to a randomization list provided by a statistician
            using the statistical software SAS 9.1. A separate randomization list was prepared
            for each participating center, to avoid center-specific effects and to assure a balanced
            distribution of both treatments within one center (stratification). Random blocks
            of different lengths were used. The randomization lists are sealed and locked up at
            the sponsor site. The envelopes will be assigned to the patients in chronological
            order by a surgeon, according to a consecutive random number.
         </p>
         <p>Each envelope contains the device (suture material for the indented suture technique)
            as well as the information about which stitch technique should be applied for abdominal
            wall closure. Randomization is performed intraoperatively and briefly before abdominal
            wall closure. After randomization, each patient obtains a unique randomization number.
            The study site confirms the randomization result by sending a fax to the sponsor.

         </div>
         <p>The treatment allocation is double-blinded. The patient and the observer responsible
            for the assessment of the clinical outcome will be unaware of the stitch length used
            for closing the midline and will have no access to the case report form. To document
            the clinical outcome of each follow-up examination, the sheets will be handed to the
            observer by an independent person (for example, a study nurse). The surgeons cannot
            be blinded because they have to know which suture length has to be applied for midline
            closure.

         <p>In both study groups, the abdominal wall closure will be performed using MonoMax®

            term absorbable, monofilament suture made of poly(4-hydroxybutyrate). In the long
            stitch group, a MonoMax® USP 1 loop in combination with a HR 48 needle will be used,
            and in the short stich group, a MonoMax® USP 2/0 single thread will be used in combination
            with a HR 26 needle. Details of the suture technique are shown in Table

         <p>The surgical procedure is carried out as usual and according to local standards regarding
            the indication for intervention. During all operations, the umbilicus has to be completely
            dissected from the linea alba for an adequate abdominal wall closure. The linea alba
            is prepared free from fat and cut precisely in the middle. In the case of a deviation,
            this is recorded in the randomization fax. After abdominal wall closure, refixation
            of the umbilicus is achieved using an absorbable suture and in interrupted suture
            technique.
         </p>
         <p>The following parameters are recorded and measured in both treatment groups:</p>
         <p> Length of the wound (cm),</p>
         <p> Number of threads used,</p>
         <p> Length of the remaining suture material (cm),</p>
         <p> Number of applied stitches,</p>
         <p> Duration for abdominal wall closure (defined as the time period from the first placement
            of the needle through the tissue until the last knot has been closed and the thread
            is cut).
         </p>
         <p>Using these data, the suture length used to close the midline will be calculated,
            as well as the suture length to wound length ratio. The number of stitches will be
            analyzed in accordance with the wound length and the length of the implanted suture
            material. The distance between the stitches can be determined as well as the lateral
            distance from the incision.

         </div>
         <p>Before the start of the trial, an initiation visit was paid to each center by the
            study management to inform and instruct the involved personnel on the study specific
            documents and procedures. To standardize both suture techniques, each participating
            center has been trained by presentations and videos; in addition, a practical workshop
            took place during the first study meeting. In three of the seven centers, surgeons
            had already used the short stitch technique before the start of the trial and have
            attended a hospitation conducted by the coordinating investigator in the Wilhelminenspital
            in Vienna, Austria. The other four centers were instructed during a visit by the coordinating
            investigator René H Fortelny before the first inclusions. All study centers were provided
            with suture material from the same batch, with the same type of stop watch for time
            measurement, a counter to enumerate the stitches, and rulers to measure the wound
            length, to standardize this equipment within the different centers.

            </p>
            <p>To analyze quality of life, the EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire will be used and documented
               by the patient preoperatively, and after 30 days, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years postoperatively.
               The EQ-5D-5 L is used in the German language version and a license has been obtained
               from the EuroQol Group by the sponsor. The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health
               status developed by the EuroQol Group to provide a simple, generic measure of health
               for clinical and economic appraisal. The questionnaire is designed for self-completion
               by respondents and takes only a few minutes to complete. Instructions to respondents
               are included in the questionnaire. The EQ-5D-5 L consists of two pages a descriptive
               system and the EQ Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS). The descriptive system comprises
               five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, anxiety
               or depression). Each dimension has five levels: no problem, slight problems, moderate
               problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The EQ-VAS records the respondent’s
               self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical visual analogue scale with endpoints labeled
               ‘the best health you can imagine’ and ‘the worst health you can imagine’.
            </p>
            <p>Short term complications include the frequency of burst abdomen and the reoperation
               rate due to burst abdomen until day of discharge. Wound infections occurring until
               the day of discharge and within 30 days after surgery will be recorded as short term
               complications. Wound infections are defined according to the US Centers for Disease
               Control and Prevention (CDC). Furthermore, wound healing complications, such as seroma,
               necrosis, and fistula, reported until 30 days postoperatively will be counted as short
               term complications.
            </p>

            <h3>Sample size calculation</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The ISSAAC study has shown a risk of 19% of developing an incisional hernia within
            one year using MonoMax® suture material and a long stitch technique for abdominal
            wall closure of a primary elective midline laparotomy 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
            </span>. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the short stitch suture technique with
            MonoMax® will decrease the incisional hernia rate after 1 year by 50% compared with
            the long stitch technique (primary endpoint). Considering hernia rates of 19% and
            9.5% in both groups, a total sample size of 424 patients (212 per group) will be necessary
            to detect this difference with a power of 80% and an alpha of 5%. Including a drop-out
            rate of 10%, a total of 468 patients will be randomized in the current study. Thus,
            each of the seven participating centers should recruit about 67 patients. To avoid
            center effects, a maximum of 200 patients may be recruited per center. Withdrawn patients
            will not be replaced.

            Additional analyses will be conducted after completion of the 3 and 5 year follow-ups.
            It is intended to publish the 1 year result as well as the 3 and 5 year results in

         <p>The hernia rate is calculated as a Kaplan-Meier estimate for the failure rate at the

            benefit of additionally taking into account the results of drop-out patients. For
            each hernia, the date of its first observation must be documented to provide a correct
            estimate. The date of hernia detected by ultrasound at a follow-up examination will
            be set to the examination date; this may lead to a slight over-estimation of the hernia

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>For several generations of surgeons, the mass-layer single stitch suture has been
         the most common and standard technique for closure of the median incision. There is
         limited evidence that even with the ‘long stitch’ technique using a loop suture, only
         one layer, the fascia only, should be included 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">15</span>
         </span> because there is less trauma to the tissue, implying a reduction in the risk of a
         burst abdomen. In addition to mesh development, today, different suture materials
         are available for closing the abdominal wall in primary laparotomies and incisional
         hernia surgery. Experimental studies and the clinical adaptation of an innovative
         ‘short stitch’ technique by the Israelsson study group 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">15</span>
         </span> clearly proved, in a controlled trial, the concept of reduced tissue trauma and the
         impact on infection and incisional hernia rates when using this technique. Reducing
         the distance between the stitches and the wound edge to between 5 and 8 millimeters,
         thereby increasing the suture/wound length ratio, and using slowly absorbable sutures
         of size USP 2/0 (polydioxanone) and a half-circle round-bodied needle (thread length:
         20 mm; arch length: 31 mm) and grasping only the aponeurosis, led to a significant
         decrease in the infection rate, as well as in the incisional hernia rate, compared
         with the ‘long stitch’ group. The average suture/wound length ratio of the ‘short
         stitch’ group of 5.7 versus 6.4 percent in the ‘long stitch group’ resulted in a significantly
         lower rate of wound infection of 5.2 versus 10.2 percent, as well as a highly significant
         lower incisional hernia rate of 5.6 versus 18 percent at the one-year follow-up. The
         multivariate analysis revealed a twofold risk of wound infection and a fourfold risk
         of incisional hernia occurring in the ‘long stitch’ group. Another randomized controlled
         trial, the STITCH study 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span> obtained similar significant results when comparing the large versus short stitch
         technique of primary midline closure. The one-year results of this study were presented
         at the annual EHS-Meeting in Edinburgh in May 2014. The incisional hernia rate in
         the large stitch group was 23%, compared with 14% for the short stitch group. In comparison
         with the Millbourn study 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span>, the incisional hernia rate is more than twice as high in the short stitch group,
         using an identical suture material. The reason for this difference might be the complete
         follow-up of all patients by ultrasound. An increase in the incisional hernia rate
         by 60% from 12 months to 36 months postoperatively has to be taken into account, as
         detected in the recently published data by Fink 
         <i>et al.</i>
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
         </span>, regarding the long term follow-up of the INSECT and ISSAAC trials 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>The significant advantage of the short stitch technique in causing minimal trauma
         to the abdominal wall seems to be clearly supported by the evidence-based level, whereas
         the synergetic effect of a special suture material used in this field has yet to be
         proven.
      </p>
      <p>Based on the use of an elastic suture material with a long-lasting strength retention
         and ultra-long absorption time (MonoMax®), the ESTOIH study can be expected to yield
         lower hernia rates than the Millbourn study 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
