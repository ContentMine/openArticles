      "Aspiration sclerotherapy is an effective therapeutic option for large symptomatic hepatic cysts. However, incomplete cyst reduction following aspiration sclerotherapy is frequently reported. Strong post-procedural cyst fluid secretion by cholangiocytes, which line the epithelium of the hepatic cyst, seems to be associated with lower reduction rates. Previous studies showed that somatostatin analogues curtail hepatic cyst fluid production. This trial will evaluate the effect of aspiration sclerotherapy combined with the somatostatin analogue pasireotide on cyst reduction. By combining treatment modalities we aim to improve cyst reduction leading to greater symptomatic relief and reduced rates of cyst recurrence."
