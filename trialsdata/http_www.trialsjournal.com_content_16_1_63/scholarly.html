                  <h3>Background</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Addiction research has hypothesised that automatic and reflective cognitive processes
                  play an important role in the onset and maintenance of alcohol (ab)use, wherein automatic
                  reactions to drug-related cues steer the drug user towards consuming before reflective
                  processes can get over and steer towards a different behavioural response. These automatic
                  processes include the tendency to attend and approach alcohol cues. These biases may
                  be trained away from alcohol via computerised cognitive bias modification (CBM). The
                  present protocol describes the design of a double-blind randomised controlled trial
                  (RCT) testing the effectiveness of attentional bias and approach bias re-training
                  with a 2×2 factorial design, alongside a brief motivational support (MS) program.

                  <h3>Methods/Design</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Participants (n = 120) are adult alcohol dependent outpatients, recruited from a public
                  health service for addiction in Italy, who have been abstinent for at least two months,
                  and with a main diagnosis of alcohol dependence disorder. Participants are randomly
                  assigned to one of four experimental conditions and complete 11 sessions of training
                  after a baseline assessment. The MS takes place before each training session. Post-intervention
                  and three-month follow-up assessments examine the change in clinical outcome variables
                  and attentional and approach biases (measured with the Visual Probe Task and the Approach-Avoidance
                  Task, respectively). Alcohol approach-avoidance implicit memory associations (measured
                  with the Brief Implicit Association Test) are also evaluated at pre- and post-intervention
                  to explore generalisation effects. Primary outcome measure is relapse rate at follow-up.
                  Secondary outcome measures include change in cognitive biases, in alcohol-related
                  implicit memory associations, and in the clinical variables assessed. An exploratory
                  analysis is also planned to detect interaction effects between the CBM modules and
                  possible moderators (interference control capacity, gender, age, number of previous
                  detoxifications) and mediators (change in cognitive bias) of the primary outcome measure.

               <p>This RCT is the first to test the effectiveness of a combined CBM intervention alongside
                  motivational support in alcohol-dependent outpatients. The results of this study can

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>People with an addiction disorder often describe their substance (ab)use as a somewhat
         ‘unconscious’ decision, something that happens ‘by chance’ and without any intentional
         planning or awareness. However, many drug users are conscious of the detrimental effects
         of substance abuse and seek treatment to abstain from consuming, citing rational considerations
         such as the costs of continued substance use outweighing the benefits. Nevertheless,
         the risk for lapse and relapse remains extremely high. This paradoxical and deleterious
         pattern of behaviour encouraged research into the mechanisms underlying drug-seeking
         behaviour even when explicit motivations to quit are present.
      </p>
      <p>It has been long known that behaviour is not only driven by rational and conscious
         processes, but also driven by mechanisms that go beyond intentionality (see Hofmann
         
         <i>et al</i>. 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>). Recently, this realisation has gained relevance in addiction research, resulting
         in efforts examining the role played by relatively automatic processes in the onset
         and maintenance of addictive behaviours 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>. At a descriptive level, dual-process models of addiction point towards two qualitatively
         different classes of information processing mechanisms underlying behaviour, namely:
      </p>
      <p>a. Automatic processes, which are initial, fast, associative and impulsive processes
         evoked by drug-related stimuli, that operate at early stages of response selection
         through associative links and emotional and motivational associations 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>. When an automatic process leads to impulsive responses or task interference conflicting
         with explicit task goals, as may well be the case in drug addiction, they are frequently
         referred to as 
         <i>cognitive biases</i>. Cognitive biases are based on associative learning processes and prior reinforcement
         and are by nature difficult to voluntarily change and control. Examples of cognitive
         biases are selective attention (for example, alcohol dependents’ attention is usually
         automatically and selectively drawn by alcohol-related cues), substance-related automatic
         associations in memory (for example, alcohol being repeatedly and automatically associated
         to positive or negative feelings) and action tendencies towards the substance (for
         example, an automatic tendency to approach alcohol cues) 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>b. Reflective processes, which are slower, relatively controlled propositional processes
         that include ‘rational’ decision-making and emotion regulation. Reflective processes
         continuously update and integrate initial inputs into more coherent and complex mental
         representations in order to optimise the selection of the final behavioural outcome
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>. To achieve this, top-down control is deployed over impulses to integrate them with
         explicit motives, beliefs and expectancies about the long-term behavioural outcomes
         and goals 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>The two classes of processes depend on each other and synergistically interact in
         determining behaviour. That means there is no process that is purely reflective or
         automatic, though the degree to which each is a more prominent determinant can be
         distinguished on the basis of their 
         <i>latency</i>. For instance, an initial automatic reaction to a positive incentive stimulus can
         be evoked (bottom-up input), such as an approach response to a glass of wine. After
         that, the initial reaction can (or cannot) progressively unfold into the action of
         grabbing the glass and drinking it under the gradual influence of conscious goals
         and motivation (top-down regulation), such as the explicit goal of alcohol abstinence
         to re-gain the lost job position 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>According to this dual-process perspective, the ‘addiction paradox’ can result from
         an imbalance between strengthened automatic reactions to substance-related cues that
         have acquired a high incentive salience after repeated consumption, while weakened
         reflective processes and cognitive control are obstructed before they can determine
         the optimal behavioural response 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span>. This imbalance between the operating processes makes the individual more at risk
         of being triggered by drug cues, thus being automatically prompted to consume the
         drug, while any deliberate decision to abstain is too late to prevent the individual
         from consuming 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Since both strengthened automatic reactions to alcohol cues and weakened reflective
         processes may be interwoven in alcohol-related problems, they both may be targeted
         in interventions. Reflective processes are usually the focal target of standard treatment
         interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, counselling and motivational
         interviewing. A common approach across such interventions consists of the therapist
         and patient making an explicit analysis of the pros and cons of the patient’s alcohol
         use, of related motives and expectancies and of strategies and long-term goals to
         enact deliberate control.
      </p>
      <p>More recently, a new family of interventions, collectively called Cognitive Bias Modification
         (CBM), has been developed to tackle prepotent, drug-evoked automatic processes involved
         in addiction 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span>. CBM paradigms are computerised tasks aimed at training alternative responses to
         a drug-related stimulus in order to adjust the biases that underlie the breakdown
         in controlled processes. Typically, they are modified versions of assessment tasks,
         such as the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">15</span>
         </span>, with a built-in contingency that recasts them to re-training paradigm.
      </p>
      <p>The first clinical applications of CBM paradigms as an add-on to standard interventions
         such as cognitive behavioural therapy have shown promising results 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
         </span>. Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with German alcohol-dependent inpatients
         did demonstrate that an approach bias for alcohol stimuli could be re-trained, with
         a generalisation of the training effects beyond the experimental procedure context
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
         </span>. Moreover, participants in the training condition had a lower rate of relapsing within
         one year after discharge, after controlling for gender in Wiers 
         <i>et al</i>. 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
         </span>, and for age and number of previous detoxifications in Eberl 
         <i>et al</i>. 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
         </span>. A study with Dutch alcohol-dependent inpatients showed the success of an attentional
         bias re-training in increasing the ability to disengage from alcohol stimuli, with
         a generalisation to untrained, new stimuli and a significantly longer time until relapse

      <p>These results could suggest that computerised CBM has the potential to be an effective
         intervention that can be easily incorporated into standard health care practices,
         alongside standard treatments. As a next step, it is important that the findings are
         replicated and extended across various patient categories and delivery modes, for
         example by combining different CBM paradigms. To the best of our knowledge, there
         is only one ongoing RCT testing a completely online CBM intervention combining the
         CBM training for alcohol approach bias, attentional bias and automatic memory associations
         among problem drinkers 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
         </span>. However, no studies have yet investigated the effectiveness of a combined CBM intervention
         with alcohol-dependent outpatients. Unlike residential treatment programs, the outpatient
         treatment regimen does not provide patients with the safe, secure and structured environment
         that isolates them from negatively influencing factors and tempting conditions. Patients
         return to their own daily environments after outpatient alcoholism treatment, and
         must voluntarily abstain from alcohol use, which requires a greater amount of diligence
         and efforts. Therefore, this group of patients is also likely to receive potential
         benefits from this type of interventions.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, inspired by the dual-process account of addictive behaviours previously presented,
         which emphasises the interaction between bottom-up and top-down processes 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>, this study is the first to include a targeted motivational support (MS) intervention
         alongside the combined CBM training, in order to integrate long-term goals with the
         training and tackle deliberate and conscious explicit motivational processes related
         to the patients’ experience of re-training their alcohol-triggered automatic responses.
         The main goal of combining CBM with a motivational approach is to enhance motivation
         to train and harness the individual’s capacity for change 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">21</span>
         </span>. At the start of each training session a brief MS interview is then included on top
         of the CBM training, with a threefold objective:
      </p>
      <p>a. To stimulate and bolster the explicit motivation and reasons for doing the training
         (goal maintenance, recall of long-term expected outcomes and top-down influence),
         which can act as a fuel to develop and exert control to overcome the appetitive motivational
         and automatic reactions towards alcohol 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>

            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>;
      </p>
      <p>b. To provide continual feedback about the participant’s subjective performance on
         the training (incentive value);
      </p>
      <p>c. To promote the acceptability of the training (
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

            <h3>The present study: aims and hypotheses</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The aim of the current study is to investigate the effectiveness of combining computerised
            alcohol attentional bias and approach bias CBM trainings in adult alcohol-dependent
            outpatients alongside a motivational approach to sustain the training progression.
            The primary goal is testing the main and added effects of the CBM interventions on
            remission progress from alcohol addiction immediately after the intervention and three
            months later, with changes in the number of lapse or relapse episodes as primary outcome
            measure. It is expected that, for each of the two CBM training modules, participants
            in the active training condition will show a lower percentage of lapse or relapse
            than participants in the placebo condition 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
            </span>-
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
            </span>.
         </p>
         <p>Secondary outcome measures include changes in alcohol-related cognitive biases following
            the combined CBM intervention. Interaction effects between the CBM modules are explored,
            as well as the additive effect of exposure to the combination of the two CBM trainings.
            It is expected that each CBM paradigm will decrease or reverse the targeted bias and
            that these changes might mediate the effects on the clinical outcome (see Eberl 
            <i>et al</i>. 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
            </span>). Further, it is expected that joint exposure to both active CBM re-trainings will
            have a greater beneficial effect than each of the active CBM re-trainings separately.
         </p>
         <p>Additionally, we study whether CBM effectiveness is moderated by participant characteristics,
            namely interference control capacity and strength of the cognitive biases at pre-test.
            Individual differences in executive functioning can moderate whether the initial automatic
            reaction towards a glass of wine can be effectively and easily controlled or not.
            It has been suggested that prolonged alcohol use can negatively affect the deployment
            of reflective processes (such as interference control and working memory capacity
            
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">22</span>
            </span>,
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">23</span>
            </span>), thereby reducing the cognitive capacity available for controlling automatic impulses
            
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
            </span>. Hence, alcohol dependents with a relatively weak ability to inhibit a prepotent
            approach response (low interference control capacity) may find it more difficult to
            remain abstinent than those with a relatively strong ability to inhibit a pre-potent
            response. CBM interventions could be particularly beneficial for those who present
            relatively poor interference control capacity and/or strong automatic reactions demanding
            great control efforts. Therefore, in line with dual-process models of addiction and
            prior findings 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
            </span>,
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
            </span>,
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">19</span>

               <span tagx="abbr">24</span>
            </span>-
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">26</span>
            </span>, it is expected that participants with strong automatic biases and/or weak interference
            control will benefit more from the CBM intervention than participants with weaker
            biases and/or stronger executive functions.
         </p>
         <p>Finally, the effect of several independent clinical variables (such as age, gender
            and number of previous detoxifications) on the primary and secondary clinical outcomes
            will be explored, in particular the type of treatments participants are receiving
            alongside the CBM, such as medication intake and/or other psychotherapeutic interventions.

            </span>, participants complete 11 sessions of either the active or placebo version of both
            attentional and approach bias training modules. The experimental intervention has
            a 2×2 factorial design, which combines the active and placebo training modules into
            four experimental conditions: one double active training experimental condition, two
            experimental groups receiving one active training and one placebo training and one
            double placebo training control group. According to the experimental design, the probability
            of receiving at least one active CBM intervention reaches 75%. The placebo version
            of each training module consists of a continuous assessment, in which half of the
            trials train the cognitive biases away towards alcohol and the other half towards
            soda (active placebo). The manipulation of the stimulus-response contingency in each
            task allows for a controlled and clean comparison between experimental conditions
            while retaining the same tasks, stimuli and instructions. Also, Wiers

            which suggested that either type of placebo could be used.

         <p>Participants complete a total of 14 sessions: two baseline assessment sessions, 11
            training sessions, one post-intervention assessment session and one three-month follow-up
            assessment session. Participants complete the training sessions with a between-session
            time interval of a maximum of five days. The post-intervention assessment takes place
            between the 10th and 11th training session during a ‘masked’ session (participants
            do not know they are completing the post-intervention evaluation). That is to avoid
            possible negative feelings related to the final ‘evaluation’ of the intervention and

         <p>Participants are adult outpatients with a main diagnosis of alcohol addiction disorder,
            recruited from the public health addiction service (Servizio per le Dipendenze, ULSS10)
            of San Donà di Piave, Italy. The targeted number of recruited participants is 120,
            to be equally balanced across the four experimental conditions.
         </p>
         <p>Participants are screened for eligibility according to the following criteria:</p>
         <p>1. Inclusion criteria: adult outpatients with primary diagnosis of alcohol addiction
            disorder according to the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
            of Mental Disorders (4th Edition, Text Revision) and alcohol abstinence for at least
            two months.
         </p>
         <p>2. Exclusion criteria: neurocognitive problems, visual or hand-motoric handicaps,
            severe neurological disorders (such as Korsakoff syndrome), comorbidity with psychotic
            disorders or low fluency in the Italian language.
         </p>
         <p>Participants are recruited by clinicians according to the inclusion and exclusion
            criteria and invited to participate in the study. At invitation, clinicians provide
            the patients with a brief introduction to the study by explaining that addiction disorders
            are partly due to uncontrolled and automatic processes which can substantially increase
            the risk for relapse, and that the main objective of the research is to test the effectiveness
            of new computerised treatment interventions, which can help the patient in gaining
            and increasing a better control over these underlying mechanisms. The clinician will
            also supervise patients’ activity and progress along both the patient’s standard treatment
            and the experimental intervention.
         </p>
         <p>After the patients are informed about the research objectives and the norms for confidential
            data treatment and for participating in the study, interested participants undersign
            a written informed consent form and create their research account at the training

         <p>Participants will be excluded from the study if they do not complete the baseline
            assessment or if they disclose the intention to discontinue the study. All participants
            will continue their treatment as usual in the public addiction service. Upon completion
            of the three-month follow-up assessment, they have the opportunity to attend the double
            active CBM training if they wish. The percentage of participants that enter the booster
            training is registered.

            stage, the participants of the present study are supposed to be in the fourth action
            stage of change, as assessed at baseline with the alcohol version of the motivation
            to treatment questionnaire (MAC-2A 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">33</span>
            </span>). This stage is characterised by the pursuit of concrete decisions and behaviours
            aimed to tackle the addiction problem and to change the status quo, and by the establishment
            of an intentional commitment to the treatment process.
         </p>
         <p>At the beginning of each training session, participants take part in a brief interview
            with a trained researcher (about 15 minutes), aimed at introducing the participant
            to the upcoming experimental session. The protocol of MS here devised has been partially
            inspired by the principles of the Motivational Interviewing approach 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">21</span>
            </span>, developed in the wake of the Trans-theoretical Model of Behaviour Change. Experimenters
            conducting the MS intervention are firstly trained with a professional in motivational
            interviewing, and later can practice the MS protocol during several role-plays with
            clinicians working in the addiction service. The interviewers regularly take part
            in supervision meetings with the same clinicians to discuss any issue related to the
            MS interviews.
         </p>
         <p>The main objective of the MS during the action stage is to support the participants’
            changes and progress reached so far in a constructive and open-minded way, by explicitly
            sustaining the efforts they are making to concretely face their addiction problems.
            In this context the efforts the participants are making include participation in the
            training sessions. The targeted MS then serves the purpose of preparing and introducing
            the participant to the upcoming experimental session, by rehearsing the objectives
            of the training, empowering the motivation to engage in the therapeutic process and
            sustaining the patient’s attention to the potential benefits of the CBM trainings.
            Namely, the strategies adopted in this phase are: reviewing progress, renewing motivation
            and redoing commitment 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">34</span>
            </span>.
         </p>
         <p>In particular, each session of MS should cover the following topics:</p>
         <p>1. Review of the previous training session (except the first training session) and
            feedback to co-structure a positive framed feedback on the progress so far.
         </p>
         <p>2. Renewal and support of the motivation and compliance to the experimental intervention.
            According to the participant’s report of the previous session, the interview proceeds
            by shifting the attention to the motives that led the participants to start the change
            process, to support and/or empower them and remind them of the objectives of this
            training. The joint rehearsing of the motivations that brought the patient to undergo
            a treatment intervention (such as ‘I don’t want my loved ones to be ashamed of me’,
            ‘I don’t want my children to grow up with an alcohol addicted father/mother’, ‘I messed
            up my life because of the drinking’ and ‘I don’t want to feel like a loser anymore’)
            should work as a fuel for continuing the intervention (long-term goals) and prepare
            the ‘field’ for the engagement of top-down control processes.
         </p>
         <p>3. Empowerment of self-efficacy and affirmation of the current changing progresses.
            The training interventions are one of the concrete actions pursued by the participant
            to deal with the alcohol abuse. It is then important to explicitly acknowledge the
            progress (precision, constancy and commitment to the tasks) and to reinforce it (for
            example, by stressing that the practice effect can be a sign of individual efficacy
            in performing the tasks and increased control over the performance).
         </p>
         <p>4. Normalisation of any difficulty encountered in the training execution and reaffirmation
            of commitment (for example, by using the metaphor of gym training). Difficulty and
            boredom are common experiences that are intrinsically part of these kinds of interventions.
            In particular, the repetition of a certain behavioural pattern is a key component
            when the objective is to strengthen ability, or a muscle for example, or to increase
            the expertise and control in some life domains, such as a job activity. This strategy
            is functional to the reinforcement of the participant’s sense of autonomy and ability
            to pursue self-chosen goals and plans.
         </p>
         <p>5. Collaborative negotiation of the incoming session proximal goals. What are the
            expectations for the next session? What is the goal the participant would like to
            reach? For example, the proximal goal of increasing the response speed or reducing
            the number of errors sounds like a challenge for some participants and consequently
            stimulates their active involvement in the task.
         </p>
         <p>Generally speaking, the interview is conducted with a specific, empathic and non-judgemental
            interviewing style and should be based on a concrete level of interaction, client-centred
            and focused on the introduction and practical discussion of the training sessions.
            The discussion of personal feelings and experiences related to the individual case
            study and relevant to the patient’s therapeutic path should be acknowledged but still
            re-addressed to the standard psychotherapeutic setting. According to the Trans-theoretical
            Model of Behaviour Change perspective, the change processes involved in the MS here
            devised deal with behavioural processes, namely, reinforcement of self-efficacy and
            managing strategies, stimuli control and relationship support, leaving the in-depth
            involvement of the experiential processes to the individual clinical setting.
         </p>
         <p>Neither the participant nor the researcher knows to which experimental condition the
            participant has been assigned. If participants enquiry about their intervention condition
            the researchers will honestly disclose their own unawareness about participants’ allocation.

            <h3>Cognitive Bias Modification interventions</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Each CBM training session consists of two modules: the attentional bias re-training
            and the approach bias re-training. Each task, both in the active and placebo version,
            consists of three blocks: a brief practice block, a mini-assessment block and a training
            block. The practice block presents neutral stimuli (grey geometrical pictures) to
            practice the task. The mini-assessment block serves the purpose of measuring the strength
            of the bias at the start of every session and tracking any change in the cognitive
            bias as a result of the CBM training.
         </p>
         <p>In both tasks, each trial starts with a fixation cross in the middle of the screen
            for a duration randomly drawn from a 
            <i>U</i>[500, 1,000] distribution. This setting was designed to make the task less boring,
            to keep participants’ attention focused and to avoid anticipatory responses. Whenever
            a wrong response is given, a red cross appears on the screen to allow for correction.
         </p>
         <p>The two tasks were designed to be as similar as possible (same stimuli and number
            of trials) to avoid any confounding effect on participants’ performance. Their order
            of presentation is counterbalanced between subjects and fixed within subjects across
            all measurement time-points.

               drink are presented next to each other on the screen for 500 ms. After the stimuli
               presentation, a small arrow (8.3% of the width and height of the picture) pointing
               upwards or downwards is presented in either of two trial formats: in half of the trials
               it replaces one of the two pictures (after format), measuring speeded detection of
               alcohol-related stimuli (attention engagement), and in the other half it is positioned
               on top of one of the pictures (on-top format), measuring the relative difficulty to
               disengage from alcohol-related stimuli (attention disengagement). Participants are

            <p>In the VPT assessment version and in the mini-assessment block during training, the
               arrow replaces the picture of alcoholics (alcohol trials) and non-alcoholics (non-alcohol
               trials) equally often. Attentional bias is computed by subtracting the median response
               time (RT) on alcohol trials from the median RT on non-alcohol trials, separately for
               after and on-top trial formats. In the training block, participants in the experimental
               condition are trained to direct their attention away from alcoholic drinks towards
               non-alcoholic drinks by exposing them only to non-alcohol trials, whereas participants
               in the placebo condition are presented with 50% alcohol and 50% non-alcohol trials

            <p>In this task, a picture of an alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink is presented in the
               centre of the screen. The picture is tilted to the left or right by three degrees.
               Participants are instructed to respond to the tilt direction of the picture by pushing
               pictures tilted to the left away from them, and pulling pictures tilted to the right
               towards them, by pressing and holding two keys (U and N) on the keyboard. The combination
               of picture tilt direction and response (left/push and right/pull versus left/pull
               and right/push) is counterbalanced across participants. Participants’ response is
               accompanied by a zooming effect, which increases picture size in the pulling closer
               response and decreases it in the pushing away response, mimicking actual approach
               and avoidance (for an example of a trial, see Figure

            <p>In the AAT assessment version and in the mini-assessment block during training, pictures

               </span>, which standardises the difference in RTs by dividing the difference by the individual
               standard deviation (SD) of RTs. An approach bias D-score is computed for alcohol ((alcohol/push − alcohol/pull)/SD(alcohol))
               and for non-alcohol trials ((non-alcohol/push − non-alcohol/pull)/SD/non-alcohol)).
               Positive scores indicate an approach tendency, negative ones indicate an avoidance
               tendency.

            <p>In the training block, participants in the experimental condition are trained to avoid
               alcohol by exposing them only to alcohol/push and non-alcohol/pull trials, whereas

               <h4>Tasks stimuli</h4>
            </div>
            <p>The current beverage picture set is an Italian adoption of the Amsterdam Beverage
               Picture Set (ABPS; Pronk T, Van Deursen DS, Beraha EM, Larsen H, Wiers RW. Validation
               of the Amsterdam Beverage Picture Set: a controlled picture set for cognitive bias
               measurement and modification paradigms. Forthcoming). As such, half of the pictures
               are passive pictures that display beverages in front of a white background, the other
               half being active pictures that display beverages being held, opened, drunk or served
               by a model in front of a white background. Prior research indicated that for heavy
               drinkers, alcohol displayed in a social setting induced stronger self-reported craving
               
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">36</span>
               </span> and stronger emotional responses 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">37</span>
               </span> than alcohol in front of a white background. This may be due to alcohol in a social
               setting being a more naturalistic cue than the alcohol without any context. In contrast,
               pictures without context did induce a stronger attentional bias 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">38</span>
               </span> than social pictures. This may be due to fast mental processes such as cognitive
               biases being most effectively triggered by simple stimuli that solely feature a stand-alone
               alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage. The pictures used in the current study were designed
               to be relatively simple, but nevertheless feature beverages both with (active) and
               without (passive) drinking contexts. This distinction is aimed at keeping pictures
               relatively simple, while allowing for a sufficiently varied stimulus set.
            </p>
            <p>The stimulus set features 144 pairs of alcohol and non-alcohol pictures matched by
               structural, visual and pictorial features and photographed in both passive (beverage
               only) and active (presence of a human in interaction with the drink) contexts. Alcohol
               pictures depict highly popular and recognisable Italian brands of wine, beer and spirits.
               A common non-alcoholic drink was selected for each alcoholic beverage by matching,
               as much as possible, the type of packaging (bottle, can, jar or carton), package size
               and colour.
            </p>
            <p>Drinks were then photographed in a neutral setting (windowless room with a table on
               a white background, full illumination on the centre of the table, various glasses
               for the different drinks, a tray and a bottle opener) and according to the following
               criteria: drinks in the foreground of the picture, consistent framing to shoot pictures
               from the same angle and use of a standard digital camera.
            </p>
            <p>Drinks were photographed in six scenarios, three for each context (passive: open beverage
               only, open beverage with empty glass and open beverage with full glass; active: woman
               serving the open drink on a tray, woman or man opening the drink and woman or man
               drinking). In woman or man active scenarios, alcoholic drinks, as well as their matched
               non-alcoholic drinks, were counterbalanced for drink category (wine, beer and spirits)
               and gender; whereas in the three passive scenarios each picture was shot in each scenario.
            </p>
            <p>Stimuli were processed in Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose,
               California, USA) to adjust for size, exposure, brightness, contrast and to correct
               minor image imperfections (see Additional file 
               <div tagx="supplr">1</div>: Table S1 for some examples of stimuli). Stimuli are randomised with 50/50 proportion
               of passive and active pictures in each task. In each training session untrained and
               already trained pictures are presented. At the pre- and post-intervention assessment
               session the VPT and AAT use different untrained stimuli. The follow-up measurement
               session is equal to the post-intervention session; the same stimuli are used.

            and pigeon), as belonging to alcohol or mammals (focal categories) or not (‘anything
            else’ category). In the subsequent four blocks (20 trials each), the alcohol focal
            category is alternatively paired with approach (block two and four) or avoid (block

         <p>The third research question of the present study is framed within a ‘what works best
            for whom?’ approach 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
            </span> and explores the moderating and mediating roles of individual differences variables
            on the clinical outcome by means of a moderated mediation analysis 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">51</span>
            </span>. More precisely, baseline strength of the cognitive biases and interference control
            capacity (Stroop task), as well as age, gender and previous detoxifications, are hypothesised
            to moderate the change in cognitive bias after the CBM intervention, which is further
            hypothesised to eventually mediate the change in the clinical outcome variable (see
            Eberl 
            <i>et al</i>. 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
            </span>).
         </p>
         <p>Finally, participants’ motivation to change (MAC2-A) at pre- and post-intervention
            will be compared via a paired t-test. Via a repeated-measures ANOVAs we will explore
            whether change in participants’ motivation to carry on with the training after the
            brief MS interviews affects attrition and training outcome.

            <h3>Sample size</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The sample size is limited to 120 recruited participants due to constraints in the
            ratio between the number of potential participants fully meeting the eligibility criteria
            and available to participate in the study, out of the total number of alcohol-dependent
            outpatients currently in charge in the public service at the time of recruitment (3:10).
            Therefore, a realistic estimate of 120 participants (n = 30 per experimental condition)
            was considered achievable for a phase II RCT study, and further supported by a minimum
            number of cases identification analysis.
         </p>
         <p>An operational guideline to identify the minimum number of cases to include in the
            study has been suggested by the Peduzzi 
            <i>et al</i>. 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">52</span>
            </span>. For 
            <i>k</i> independent variables and 
            <i>p</i> as the smallest of the proportions of negative or positive cases in the population,
            then the minimum number of participants is 10*k/p. Based on three previous CBM studies
            with alcohol dependent clinical populations, the average proportions of occurrence
            or absence of relapse event(s) at follow-up are about 0.53 and 0.47 after an approach
            bias or control re-training, respectively 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
            </span>,
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
            </span>; and about 0.40 and 0.28 after an attentional bias or control re-training, respectively
            
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
            </span>. The proportions were computed out of the total number of enrolled participants.
         </p>
         <p>By taking the minimum among the four proportion values and setting 
            <i>k</i> = 2 (two independent variables: attentional bias CBM re-training or placebo and approach
            bias CBM re-training or placebo), the minimum number of cases to be included in the
            present study is 10*2/0.28 ≅ 71. According to this approach, the proposed sample size
            is more than adequate to answer to the primary research question of the present study
            and should also allow for high attrition rates. It is worth noting that Wiers 
            <i>et al</i>. 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
            </span> and Eberl 
            <i>et al</i>. 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
            </span> had a one-year follow-up period, whereas Schoenmakers 
            <i>et al</i>. 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
            </span> had a three-month follow-up period. The different follow-up timing allows only a
            partial comparison of the above-mentioned proportions. If similar proportions at one-year
            of follow-up were also observed in Schoenmakers 
            <i>et al</i>. 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
            </span> then the minimum number of cases would decrease to 10*2/0.47 ≅ 43.
         </p>
         <p>An additional sensitivity power analysis was carried out for a simple logistic regression
            analysis on the binary outcome variable separately for the two cognitive bias re-training
            modules, to detect the minimal detectable effect in the present study as a function
            of significance level α, statistical power (1-β) and sample size. The null hypothesis
            (H
            <sub>0</sub>) stated that the probability (p
            <sub>1</sub>) of presenting a relapse event (Y = 1) in the active training condition (X = 1) equals
            the relapse rate in the placebo condition (X = 0) detected in previous studies (H
            <sub>0</sub>: p
            <sub>1</sub> = p(Y = 1|X = 0) = p(Y = 1|X = 1)).
         </p>
         <p>For the approach bias CBM training, p
            <sub>1</sub> = 0.60, since about 60% of participants in the placebo condition relapsed 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
            </span>,
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
            </span>, whereas for the attentional bias CBM training p
            <sub>1</sub> = 0.18 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
            </span>. The targeted value for the latter was 0.18; however, given the small sample size
            (n = 43) and almost 20% attrition rate in Schoenmakers 
            <i>et al</i>. 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
            </span>, similarly to the approach bias CBM training, a 60% relapse rate in the placebo condition
            is assumed.
         </p>
         <p>The alternative hypothesis (H
            <sub>1</sub>) states that in the active condition the probability (p
            <sub>2</sub>) of presenting a relapse event is lower than in the placebo condition (H
            <sub>1</sub>: p
            <sub>2</sub> = p(Y = 1|X = 1) &lt; p
            <sub>1</sub>). Assuming a power of 0.80, a binomial distribution of Y and a one-tailed significance
            test, for n = 120 the projected odds-ratio or minimal detectable effect is 0.396 (critical
            z = −1.645) for both approach bias active versus placebo training and attentional
            bias active versus placebo training (G*Power 3.1, open-source software

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The present paper describes the design of a double-blind RCT protocol to test the
         effectiveness of a computerised CBM intervention that targets alcohol-related maladaptive
         impulsive responses, which combines the attentional bias re-training and approach
         bias re-training in a 2×2 factorial design with the inclusion of motivational elements
         in each re-training session.
      </p>
      <p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the implementation
         of a combined CBM intervention alongside a targeted motivational intervention before
         each CBM session to sustain the training process in a clinical sample of outpatients.
         On a conceptual and clinical level, the combination of CBM with motivational elements
         specifically related to the contingent training context follows the dual-process account
         of addiction disorders, in which both the initial impulsive reactions to alcohol cues
         and the later in time, more reflective and deliberate processes can be targeted in
         intervention to bolster top-down control processes over impulses 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>. Weakening automatic appetitive processes by providing an alternative response option
         (training towards non-alcoholic stimuli) and simultaneously stressing the motivation
         (positive incentives) for more reflective and goal-directed behaviour is a double-pronged
         approach; both automatic and reflective processes are targeted. Furthermore, the motivation
         enhancement approach of the interview serves the purpose of levering participants’
         commitment to and engagement in the training, which may well be perceived as monotonous
         and boring after a few sessions due to the inherent repetitiveness of the tasks.
      </p>
      <p>One could argue that the MS should also have been experimentally manipulated to double-check
         its actual effects. Although that could have been experimentally optimal, it was not
         the main objective of the study. The leading focus was on the effects of the combination
         of two CBM interventions alongside the introduction of motivational elements. The
         MS was in fact conceived as a tool to optimise potential treatment effects of the
         CBM modules and to increase the acceptability and credibility of the CBM interventions,
         thus reducing attrition rates and improving the compliance to the training by subsuming
         the incentive value of long-term goal states 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>A second strength of the present study bears the investigation of the combination
         of different CBM training with alcohol dependent outpatients. Up to now, the separate
         effects of CBM interventions have been mainly studied in samples of heavy drinkers
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">54</span>
         </span> and residential inpatients 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
         </span>, while the combined effects of multiple web-based CBM trainings are currently under
         investigation with a broader sample of at-risk and problematic drinkers 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
         </span>. Therefore, the second strength of the present study comes from the exploration of
         the potential effects of a CBM intervention in a different group of recipients who
         are also likely to benefit from the intervention. Alcohol dependent outpatients are
         usually characterised by cycles of relapses alternated with periods of abstinence,
         thus featuring their alcohol problems with a higher chronicity. When considering CBM
         modules as low-cost interventions that may potentially reduce the relapse rate and/or
         prolong the period of abstinence 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
         </span>, therefore also prospectively deflating the number of patients that cyclically turn
         to addiction services to subside their relapse, the inclusion of CBM modules in the
         outpatient regimen of addiction interventions may be very cost-effective.
      </p>
      <p>The third strength of the study lies in the adoption of a factorial design, which
         allows the detection of the main but also the incremental effects of combining two
         CBM interventions. Unfortunately, the main pitfall covers the lack of published results
         on the combination of different CBM paradigms, which did not permit the running of
         a proper 
         <i>a priori</i> power analysis to set out the optimal sample size, as the effect of simultaneously
         targeting two cognitive biases at once is still unknown. The same applies to possible
         interaction effects between the two re-trainings, since as yet no published studies
         have tested, for instance, the effect of an approach bias re-training over the attentional
         bias or vice versa. These shortages could be considered as a drawback of the study
         in terms of power; however, they are also part of the main strengths, since the exploration
         of any interaction and/or additive effect of multiple CBM interventions is a key objective
         of the present study, and potentially fruitful for CBM research and clinical applications.
         Furthermore, a sensitivity power analysis for a multiple logistic regression makes
         it possible to at least have an ideal projection of the minimal detectable effect
         for the main effects of the two training modules. The identified values can then be
         used as a guideline when carrying out the data analysis of the present RCT and check
         for the actual sensitivity of the test in detecting the sought effect.
      </p>
      <p>Last but not least, the RCT design includes the assessment of the effects of the CBM
         modules in the long run by measuring participants’ cognitive biases in a follow-up
         session. So far, only a few studies have investigated the long-term effects of CBM
         on cognitive biases, particularly for attentional bias 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">55</span>
         </span>. Given the potential of CBM, more extended evaluations of training effects and of
         the relation between (long-lasting) cognitive bias change and primary outcome have
         been called for 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">55</span>
         </span>. In summary, the present longitudinal assessment of attention and approach bias in
         alcohol outpatients can be valuable for both assessing its application in an important
         patient category and gaining deeper understanding of the working mechanisms of CBM.
      </p>
      <p>A final remark goes to the generalizability of this RCT protocol, which is easily
         adaptable for other substances beyond alcohol and for diverse behavioural addictions,
         such as gambling and binge eating disorders. Clinical assessment measures and task
         stimuli can be customized for the targeted problems and/or disorder(s) while keeping
         unaltered the design of the experimental set-up and the CBM tasks. Better replicable
         RCT designs have been called for by a recent critical meta-analysis on the effectiveness
         of CBM interventions 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">56</span>
         </span>. By extensively describing the RCT protocol separately, as done in the current paper,
         we hope to facilitate the cross-substance adaptation and reproducibility of CBM research
         findings.
