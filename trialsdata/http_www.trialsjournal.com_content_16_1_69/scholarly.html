                  <h3>Background</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Fecal incontinence has a high prevalence in the older population, which cannot be
                  explained by comorbidity or the anatomical or psychological changes of aging alone.
                  Fecal incontinence leads to a high economic burden to the healthcare system and is
                  an important cause of institutionalization. In addition, fecal incontinence is associated
                  with shame, social isolation and reduced quality of life. The importance of identifying
                  treatable causes in the frail elderly is strongly emphasized. It is recommended that
                  an assessment of fecal incontinence should be implemented as part of an evaluation
                  of older patients. Although there is a substantial evidence base to guide choice of
                  implementation activities targeting healthcare professionals, little implementation
                  research has focused on the care of older people nor involved care processes or care
                  personnel. This study is based on the assumption that fecal incontinence among nursing
                  home patients can be prevented, cured or ameliorated by offering care staff knowledge
                  of best practice through a multifaceted educational program. The primary objective
                  is to test the hypothesis that a multifaceted educational program for nursing home
                  care staff on assessment and treatment of fecal incontinence reduces patients’ frequency
                  of fecal incontinence.

                  <h3>Methods/design</h3>
               </div>
               <p>The study is a two-armed, parallel cluster-randomized controlled trial. Primary outcome
                  is the frequency of fecal incontinence among patients. Sample size calculations resulted
                  in a need for a total sample of 240 patients. Twenty nursing home units in one city
                  in Norway will be recruited and allocated to intervention or control by an independent
                  statistician using computer-generated tables. The intervention is a multifaceted educational
                  program. Units in the control arm will provide care as usual. The intervention period
                  is 3 months. Data will be collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Data will be analyzed
                  using mixed effect models with the cluster treated as a random effect.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Fecal incontinence (FI) is defined by the International Consultation on Incontinence
         as ‘the involuntary loss of liquid or solid stool that is a social or hygienic problem’
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. FI has a higher prevalence in the elderly population than in younger people, which
         cannot be explained by comorbidity or the anatomical and psychological changes of
         aging alone 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. In the nursing home (NH) population, previous studies suggest a prevalence of FI
         between 10 and 69% 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>, but it is most often reported to be between 40 and 55% 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>. The varying prevalence may be due to the lack of a consistent definition of FI,
         although differences in the quality of continence care in the NHs might also be an
         explanation 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>FI leads to a high direct and indirect economic burden to the healthcare system, and
         is an important cause of institutionalization of older patients 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>. In addition, FI is associated with shame, social isolation and reduced quality of
         life 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>. FI among older patients has a more complex etiology compared to the younger population
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>, and the importance of identifying treatable causes of FI in frail older people,
         rather than just managing symptoms passively, is strongly emphasized 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. The level of awareness among health personnel regarding appropriate assessment and
         treatment options for FI seems limited 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span>. Further, there are indications that both older patients themselves and health personnel
         consider FI to be a normal part of aging for which nothing can be done 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span>. It is recommended that an assessment of FI should be implemented as part of an evaluation
         of older patients 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>There is a substantial evidence base to guide choice of implementation activities
         targeting healthcare professionals in general 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
         </span>. However, relatively little of the implementation research has focused on the care
         of older people or involved care processes or care personnel 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
         </span>. Even though the evidence is not fully conclusive, implementation research suggests
         that the most effective method for changing the behavior of health personnel in long-term
         care settings involves multifaceted educational efforts such as written materials
         or toolkits combined with individual educational visits, small group training or feedback
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span>,

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>This study is based on the hypothesis that FI among NH patients can be prevented,
         cured or ameliorated by offering NH care staff knowledge of best practice through
         a multifaceted educational program on assessment and treatment of FI. The study has
         been developed according to guidelines for developing and testing complex interventions
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">23</span>
         </span>. As there are very few trials either on the treatment of FI in NH patients or on
         continence education programs for care staff, it was considered necessary to investigate
         feasibility before evaluating the complex intervention with a randomized controlled
         trial 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
         </span>. Thus, a pilot study was conducted in autumn 2013. The results are not yet published,
         but the experiences and results have been used in the planning of this cluster-randomized
         controlled trial.

            <h3>Aims and objectives</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The overall aim of this study is to achieve a reduction in bowel leakage and accidents
            for NH patients by altering the quality of continence care among registered nurses
            (RNs), authorized social educators (ASEs, see below), and care staff in general. The
            primary objective is to test the hypothesis that a multifaceted educational program
            for NH care staff on assessment and treatment of FI reduces patients’ frequency of
            FI.
         </p>
         <p>Secondarily, the trial will investigate the effect of a multifaceted educational program
            for NH care staff on 1) remission of FI among patients with FI present at baseline
            or the incidence of new cases of FI among patients identified as continent at baseline;
            2) change in NH patients’ FI-related concerns such as mood, constipation, diarrhea
            and skin condition; 3) increased knowledge among RNs and ASEs; 4) change of practice
            among RNs, ASEs and care staff in general; 5) and reduction in costs related to FI
            management. The study also intends to investigate correlates of FI in the NH population.

      </div>
      <p>The study is a parallel two-armed cluster randomized controlled trial (C-RCT) with
         a repeated cross-sectional design. As there will be considerable overlap between patients
         included at the different data-collection time points, some outcomes will be treated
         as if they come from a cohort design.

            <h3>Setting</h3>
         </div>
         <p>In Norway, the municipalities have a statuary obligation to provide NH care to those
            who need it. Most Norwegian NHs are owned and run by the municipalities, and financed
            by a combination of taxes and patient payment. NH size varies between 20 and 120 beds,
            divided into units most commonly with 15 beds. NHs are managed by RNs and have an
            agreement with a general practitioner (GP) who visits the NH once a week. There are
            no legal requirements for staff-to-patient ratios or specifications for qualifications
            required for workers 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">24</span>
            </span>. However, NHs have RNs and/or ASEs on duty 24 hours a day, and according to unpublished
            information from Statistics Norway the staff comprises on average 31% RNs/ASEs, 45%
            licensed practical nurses (care education on high school level most often before age
            18) , and 24% healthcare aides (no vocational health education). Statistics Norway
            has overall responsibility for official statistics in Norway. In Norway, an ASE has
            a bachelor’s degree and provides daily care to persons in need, particularly those
            with intellectual disability, including dementia. ASEs have a defined healthcare and
            pharmacological competence

         </div>
         <p>The educational program has been developed according to recommendations from implementation

            </span>. A research group comprising four researchers will facilitate the educational program

            Educational content, pedagogical methods and a paper-based guideline for nurse-led
            assessment and treatment of FI (the FI-guideline, see below) were developed for this
            study by expert consensus and were evaluated in the pilot study.

               <i>The FI-guideline</i> is based on best practice recommendations

               </span> and will be introduced to the RNs/ASEs in the intervention NHs during the workshop
               (see below). The FI-guideline facilitates a systematic assessment of bowel symptom
               history and bowel patterns. As FI among NH patients is considered to have a complex
               etiology, the guideline encourages the RN/ASE to consider a range of possible causes.
               Examples are loose stools, immobility, cognitive impairment, impaction and use of
               laxatives. Based on this assessment, the RN/ASE defines a nursing diagnosis, for example:
               ‘FI related to loose stools, possibly due to excessive laxatives, urgency and reduced
               mobility. This leads to FI episodes with loose stool and red perineal skin’. The guideline
               then offers a range of possible interventions. The result of the paper-based assessment,
               the nursing diagnosis and interventions, is then documented in the patient’s EPR as
               an individualized care plan.

               <i>One one-day educational meeting</i> (7 hours) is defined by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care
               (EPOC) as ‘participation of healthcare providers in conference, lectures, workshops
               or traineeships’ 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
               </span>. The educational meeting will be organized as an interactive workshop, which targets
               knowledge, attitudes, and skills. The workshop will be conducted in a local meeting
               room in each intervention NH. Part one of the workshop includes the RNs/ASEs filling
               in a knowledge test (which is part of the data collection). However, by organizing
               it as a part of the workshop, the pedagogical intention is to facilitate learning,
               as it is possible to find the answers in the following theoretical input. Part two
               of the workshop is case-based discussion concerning the FI-guideline. As individualization
               of the nurse’s diagnoses and the interventions is essential, an important pedagogical
               intention is to empower the RNs/ASEs’ clinical and critical thinking. Another important
               issue is how to integrate the use of the guideline with the electronic patient record
               (EPR) system. The topics for the educational meeting, including the FI-guideline,
               will be made available for the staff as printed educational material

               <i>A local opinion leader</i> is defined by EPOC as ‘use of providers nominated by their colleges as educationally

                  <span tagx="abbr">14</span>

                  <span tagx="abbr">34</span>
               </span> by asking the care manager who is considered to be a principle source of influence.
               One opinion leader per unit will be recruited. The opinion leader will, together with
               the care manager, participate in an additional 1.5 hour educational meeting regarding
               the role of the opinion leader and care manager for this study. They will also receive
               contact information for the researcher for support during the intervention period.
               The care manager has responsibility for facilitating adherence to the program and
               the guidelines in cooperation with the opinion leader.
            </p>
            <p>
               <i>Educational outreach</i> is defined by EPOC as ‘use of a trained person who meets with providers in their
               practice setting to give information with the intent of changing the providers’ practice’
               
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
               </span>. The researcher will meet with the healthcare personnel in the practice setting six
               times for 1.5 hours each time during the 3-month intervention period. The opinion
               leader will make an agreement with the researcher on how to work and what to focus
               on between meetings. The NH care staff as a whole is the target group for the educational
               outreach and will be invited to participate in the educational meetings throughout
               the intervention period. Facilitating and empowering the staff’s critical and clinical
               thinking is the main pedagogical approach. The pilot study identified a culture of
               discontinuity among staff in reporting important clinical observations and decisions
               in the EPR as an essential barrier to change. In addition, even if decisions were
               reported in the EPR, it was a problem that staff did not check the patients’ EPR for
               changes in the patients’ care procedures, which resulted in the patients not receiving
               the correct interventions for his/her condition. Thus, it will be important to facilitate
               NH unit-specific strategies to ensure continuity in FI care for the individual patient.

            <h3>Sample size</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Sample size calculations are based on the primary outcome: frequency of FI among patients.
            The power calculations have taken into account the results from the pilot study. The
            pilot study identified the primary outcome variable to be skewed to the right, and
            methodological consideration resulted in a dichotomization of the primary outcome
            variable with a cut off between 2 (continent, continent with a stoma and seldom incontinent)
            and 3 (occasionally incontinent, often incontinent and incontinent). Based on results
            from the pilot study, we hypothesized that a reasonable and clinically important effect
            size in the intervention group compared to the control group would be 15% between
            the two groups in proportions with FI (score of 3 to 5). As the design is a cluster
            randomized trial, we need to adjust for clustering. The intracluster correlation coefficient
            (ICC) is estimated to be 0.04. The estimate is based on published patterns in ICCs

            we had access to the FI variable with the categories 0 to 4 from an epidemiological
            study of 980 NH patients in Trondheim municipality

            model, 5% level of significance, test strength of 80%, an average cluster size of
            15 patients, and an ICC of 0.04, a study population of 103 patients in each arm of
            the C-RCT is needed. The number of individuals in each cluster is set because each
            unit has a fixed number of beds. Assuming a 15% dropout, the sample needed is 120
            patients in each arm. This means a total of 240 patients and about 20 NH units (Figure

            inclusion of covariates at both the individual and cluster level. Relevant covariates
            at the individual level in a multiple logistic regression model are age, sex, length
            of stay in NH, cognitive performance, mobility, functionality, diarrhea, constipation.
            Hence, this study will use mixed effect models with the cluster treated as a random
            effect. Analyses will be computed using Stata 12.1.

            <h3>Ethics</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics
            (REK) (2013/1802/REK North) and by The Norwegian Social Science Data Services (36482/2/MB).
            NH leaders will be informed and give permission to perform the study in the individual
            NH. Informed consent will be obtained from RNs/ASEs concerning the knowledge test.
            An essential ethical consideration in this study is whether or not informed consent
            should be obtained from patients or their representatives. After evaluating the overall
            project, the REK authorized RNs/ASEs with dispensations from the duty of confidentiality
            to gather relevant patient health information in order to measure effect of the educational
            intervention. Since dispensation was given, consent will not be obtained. The justifications
            of the conclusion are 1) the process of assessing the patients’ cognitive ability
            to read and understand information, and the distribution of the information letter
            to the patients or their representatives, is considered as inconvenient for the patients
            and time consuming for care staff who would need to undertake this; 2) the gathering
            of patient data will not involve interviewing or examining patients, and the data
            in question is based on assessments made by RNs/ASEs who have good knowledge of the
            patients; and 3) the purpose of the study is to evaluate effect of an educational
            program for care staff. Patients are not the ones recruited to participate in the
            intervention. All patient information will be de-identified by care staff before transfer
            to the researcher. The codebook will be stored separate from the patient data according
            to storing routines by the responsible research institution, Sør-Trøndelag University
            College. The study will be performed in concordance with the Helsinki Declaration.
            The project is registered in the clinical trial registry (NCT02183740).

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The aim of this study is to achieve reduction in bowel leakage and accidents for NH
         patients. The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that a multifaceted educational
         program for NH care staff on assessment and treatment of FI, reduces patients’ frequency
         of FI.
      </p>
      <p>Major strengths of this study include thorough investigation of both what is considered
         best practice for assessment, care and treatment of FI among NH patients and what
         are considered to be the most effective implementation strategies. The study has a
         rigorous design with randomization, control and blinding where possible. The intervention
         is classified as a complex intervention, and the study has been designed according
         to published recommendations 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">21</span>
         </span>, where a thorough planning phase included an evaluation of the fit of the different
         components with a pilot study. In addition, a strength is that we will collect comprehensive
         information at three levels: NH units, RNs/ASEs and patients. It is of special interest
         that the educational intervention integrates the FI-guideline of best practice into
         the EPR as a mean to communicate the assessment and care plan to the staff as a whole.
         Because of this, we will have the opportunity to evaluate change of practice by investigating
         the EPR together with the use of the FI-guideline and patient’s health information.
      </p>
      <p>A weakness of the study is the complexity of the intervention with limited possibility
         to evaluate which of the components in the educational intervention is effective.
         The more complex the intervention, the harder it is to measure effect 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
         </span>. With an educational intervention, we also have the problem with the pedagogical
         ideal versus ideals for an RCT. An important pedagogic ideal is to individualize and
         adjust pedagogical methods according to the needs of the actual person/group in front
         of you 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">15</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">29</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">31</span>
         </span>. On the other hand, an important ideal of an RCT is that the intervention is as similar
         as possible for all the participants 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">45</span>
         </span>. In this study, we have agreed that some components will be the same, and some are
         allowed to vary. For instance, the format of the workshop will be the same, (total
         hours and themes to be covered), while empowerment strategies, guidance and timeframes
         for individual themes during the day may vary. During educational outreach, all participants
         will receive the same number of visits within the same time frame and main themes
         to be covered, whereas the when and how will vary.
      </p>
      <p>As it is the RNs/ASEs who will fill in the questionnaires on the patients’ health
         status, there is a risk for proxy bias. To counter for that, both the interRAI manual
         and the information meetings focus on how to include the patient when possible. However,
         since about 80% of the NH patients have some kind of cognitive impairment 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">46</span>
         </span>, the RNs/ASEs’ clinical judgment of the patients’ health status will be the main
         source of information. The RNs/ASEs involved in the data collection will also be part
         of the intervention, which means that they will not be blinded to care interventions.
         The RNs/ASEs will be informed about the importance of objectivity of observations
         and assessments at all data collection time points. There is also a risk for detection
         bias as those who have received education might recognize FI more frequently than
         before intervention.
      </p>
      <p>This study is the first RCT specifically focusing on this neglected area. The results
         of the study will give evidence for best practice for FI care in NHs, and organizational
         advice concerning implementation strategies.
