      "Despite adequate treatment, up to 30% of treated antihypertensive patients with primary, uncomplicated hypertension remain uncontrolled. We proposed that high intracellular activity of the ATP regenerating enzyme creatine kinase (CK) increases pressor responses and hypertension risk. In line with this, we found that plasma CK activity after rest, a surrogate measure of tissue activity, is the main predictor of blood pressure levels and failure of antihypertensive therapy in the general population. In addition, the creatine analog and competitive oral creatine kinase inhibitor beta-guanidinopropionic acid effectively and safely reduced blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. However, to our knowledge there are no human data on the safety of oral supplementation with this substance. Therefore, we will assess the tolerability of beta-guanidinopropionic acid in men, compared to creatine and placebo."
