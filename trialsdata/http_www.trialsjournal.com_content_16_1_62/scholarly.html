                  <h3>Background</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Suicidal thoughts are common in the general population, causing significant disability.
                  However, a substantial number of people struggling with suicidality do not access
                  appropriate services. Online self-help may help overcome barriers to help-seeking.
                  This study aims to examine the effectiveness of an online self-help program targeted
                  at reducing suicidal thoughts compared with an attention-matched control condition
                  in the Australian adult population. This trial is based on a Dutch self-help program,
                  which was found to be effective in reducing suicidal thoughts.

                  <h3>Methods/Design</h3>
               </div>
               <p>A total of 570 community-dwelling adults (18 to 65 years old) with suicidal thoughts
                  will be recruited via various media and randomly assigned to the 6-week online program
                  aimed at reducing suicidal thoughts or a 6-week attention-matched control program.
                  Primary outcome measure is the severity of suicidal thoughts. Secondary outcome measures
                  include suicide plans, capacity to cope with suicidal thoughts, reasons for living,
                  symptoms of depression, hopelessness, anxiety/worry, rumination, panic, perceived
                  burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, acquired capability, alcohol consumption,
                  insomnia, and various cost-effectiveness measures.

                  <h3>Discussion</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Although the original Dutch trial found web-based self-help to be effective in reducing
                  suicidal thoughts, randomized controlled trials (RCT) of online programs for suicidal
                  thoughts are rare. The present study extends previous research by running the first
                  English language RCT of this sort. As a result of the original study, the current
                  RCT includes refinements to the design, including greater levels of participant anonymity
                  and longer follow-up periods. Limitations of this trial include the potential for
                  high drop-out and the inability to ascertain whether any suicides occur during the
                  study.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Suicidal thoughts are common in the general population. A cross-national study of
         17 countries reported an average lifetime prevalence of 9.2% for suicidal thoughts,
         3.1% for plans, and 2.7% for attempts. However, there was considerable variability
         in prevalence rates between the countries 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. In Australia, an estimated 13.3% of adults experience suicidal thoughts at some
         stage in their lives, 4.0% make a suicide plan, and approximately 3.2% of adults attempt
         suicide 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>A significant proportion of people with suicidal thoughts or plans do not use services
         for mental health problems (in Australia, 40.9% and 32.0% respectively). In people
         who attempt suicide, about one in four (26.6%) fail to access services 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. In a worldwide survey, it was found that 44% of people experiencing any suicidal
         outcome in high income countries do not receive treatment 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>, indicating that current services do not reach everyone in need.
      </p>
      <p>Reasons for a failure to seek help among suicidal people are diverse and likely to
         be complex. However, factors that may play a role include fear of stigma, shame, dissatisfaction
         or past negative experiences with mental health services, preference for self-reliance
         (handling the problem alone), denying the severity of the problem, and financial constraints
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>It is widely acknowledged that suicide prevention services that are anonymous, confidential
         and readily available appeal to those at risk. Illustrative of this is the worldwide
         use of telephone support services. Although these are generally perceived as a valuable
         suicide prevention strategy, evidence for their effectiveness is limited and equivocal
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>. The internet is also increasingly being used as a source of information and of help
         and support for suicidal people and their loved ones, as demonstrated by the availability
         of peer-to-peer support forums, e-mail and chat therapy services, crisis chat services,
         and self-tests with advice and referrals 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span>. Reviews of empirical studies into online suicide prevention efforts show that this
         is an emergent but promising field 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>There is also recent evidence that web-based programs are associated with a reduction
         of suicidal thoughts. An uncontrolled study into web-based Cognitive Behavior Therapy
         (CBT) for depression found that suicidal ideation decreased post-treatment 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">15</span>
         </span>. A randomized controlled (RCT) trial into online CBT for depression found reductions
         in suicidal thoughts irrespective of group allocation 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span>. Both these earlier trials were of depression interventions. A Dutch trial studying
         an online unguided self-help program aimed specifically at reducing suicidal thoughts
         found this program to be effective compared to a control condition receiving psycho
         education 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
         </span>. To permit further and broader investigation, the Dutch program has now been translated
         into English.
      </p>
      <p>This paper describes the protocol of the ‘Healthy Thinking’ trial, which aims to include
         570 community dwelling adults living in Australia. Participants will be randomly allocated
         to one of the following conditions: ‘Living with Deadly Thoughts’ (LWDT) - the web-based
         self-help program aimed at helping people reduce suicidal thoughts, or ‘Living Well’
         - an attention-matched control condition. This trial is based on the previous Dutch
         trial 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
         </span>, but was adapted to the Australian context and improved. Limitations of the Dutch
         trial included the use of a waitlisted psycho-education control group, introducing
         unequal amounts of material presented to each group as a potential confound. The current
         trial utilizes an attention-matched comparator condition to account for this. In addition,
         participants in the Dutch trial were not anonymous, which may have impacted sample
         representativeness due to (un)willingness to participate. The current trial therefore
         offers anonymity as an option. Safety procedures developed specifically for the trial
         will operate while still permitting anonymous participation. These are documented
         here. Finally, the current trial employs a longer follow-up period to gauge longer-term
         maintenance of effects, and the look and feel of the program website has been improved
         to enhance user experience.
      </p>
      <p>The primary objective of this parallel group RCT is to determine whether the Living
         with Deadly Thoughts program is superior to the Living Well program. It is hypothesized
         that participants receiving the LWDT program will have lower levels of suicidal thoughts
         on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) relative to the control condition
         at post-test (6 weeks). The relative advantage of the active program compared to the
         control program is expected to be maintained at 6 and 12 month follow-up.
      </p>
      <p>The key secondary outcomes include suicide plans, capacity to cope with suicidal thoughts,
         reasons for living, symptoms of depression, hopelessness, anxiety/worry, rumination,
         panic, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, acquired capability, alcohol
         consumption, insomnia, help-seeking intentions and health care utilization. Relative
         to the control condition, LWDT participants are expected to 1) show a reduction of
         self-reported suicide plans at post-test and at 6 and 12 month follow-up; 2) show
         an improvement of capacity to cope with suicidal thoughts at post-test and 6 and 12 months;
         3) experience an increase in ‘reasons for living’ at post-test, 6 and 12 months; 4)
         have lower symptoms of depression, hopelessness, anxiety/worry, rumination, panic,
         perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and disability at post-test, 6 and
         12 months; and 5) demonstrate an increase in help-seeking intentions and utilization
         of primary and mental health care at 6 and 12 months (but not necessarily in hospitalization).
      </p>
      <p>For participants in the active group, improvements in suicidality (as measured by
         suicidal ideation, suicide plans and capacity to cope with suicide thoughts) are hypothesized
         to be associated with reduction of anxiety and depressive symptoms; a history of fewer
         self-reported attempts; shorter history of suicidal thinking; reduction in rumination;
         and improvement in perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. Improvement
         in suicidality is not expected to be related to changes in capability to attempt suicide,
         as per Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">20</span>

         baseline levels of hopelessness and higher baseline levels of internet literacy. Trial
         dropout at post-test, 6 and 12 months is hypothesized to be associated with higher

         <p>This study is designed as a two-arm randomized controlled trial with one active program
            (‘Living with Deadly Thoughts’) and one control program (‘Living Well’). There will
            be five main measurement occasions: screening, baseline, post-test (6 weeks after
            baseline), and two follow-up measures (6 and 12 months after post-test). In addition,
            suicidal thoughts will be monitored on a fortnightly basis during the first six weeks
            after randomization (that is, while the active group goes through the active program)
            to inform safety procedures (see below). The trial flow is illustrated in Figure 
            <div tagx="figr">1</div>. Participants who stop using the program they are assigned to will still be sent
            all follow-up questionnaires to complete (unless they have requested to be withdrawn
            from the study).

            <h3>Sample and recruitment</h3>
         </div>
         <p>A total of 570 Australian community dwelling adults experiencing suicidal thoughts
            will be recruited through various online and offline media, relevant websites, popular
            social networking sites and advertising on popular search engines. Through these advertisements,
            respondents are linked to a welcome screen where a brief introduction to the study
            is provided. Next, respondents will be invited to provide informed consent to complete
            the online screening procedure to verify eligibility.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div id="">
         <div tagx="st">
            <h3>Eligibility and screening</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Eligibility is based on 1) being aged between 18 and 65, 2) having a valid email address,
            3) having a reliable internet connection, 4) currently being located in Australia,
            5) being fluent in English, 6) never having been diagnosed with a psychotic disorder
            such as schizophrenia, 7) currently experiencing suicidal thoughts, and 8) not having
            attempted suicide in the past month.
         </p>
         <p>During screening, respondents indicate their eligibility by answering questions about
            the above criteria. Ineligibility during the screening process results in redirection
            to a ‘thank you’ page with relevant referral information. Respondents who are excluded
            based on a recent suicide attempt (past month) are also provided with the opportunity
            to submit their phone number to receive a phone call from the Suicide Call Back Service
            (SCBS: a 24-hour, Australia-wide, not-for-profit service that provides telephone counseling
            to people who are suicidal).
         </p>
         <p>All eligible respondents are provided with a participant information statement, which
            outlines that participation includes agreeing to make contact with the SCBS and completing
            the baseline questionnaire before being randomly allocated to one of the two programs.
            Making initial contact with the SCBS is needed as this organization plays a significant
            role in the safety procedures (described in more detail below). After having read
            the participant information statement (see Additional file 
            <div tagx="supplr">1</div>), respondents will be invited to provide informed consent online (see Additional
            file 
            <div tagx="supplr">2</div>) and will need to provide only a valid email address and a first name to register

               <h4>Background</h4>
            </div>
            <p>It has been convincingly demonstrated that online self-help interventions reduce mental
               health problems 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">24</span>
               </span>-
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">29</span>
               </span>. Self-help is nowadays often offered through the Internet and can be delivered with
               or without support. Guided self-help generally shows larger effect sizes 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">24</span>
               </span> and lower dropout rates, whereas unguided self-help has the advantage that it can
               be delivered to a large number of people at relatively low cost.
            </p>
            <p>There is a large body of research indicating that Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)
               is effective for many different mental health problems 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">30</span>
               </span>, and most of the existing (effective) self-help interventions are based on CBT 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">31</span>
               </span>. The program used in this trial is called Living with Deadly Thoughts and is a translation
               and adaptation of the Dutch web-based program ‘
               <i>Leven onder Controle</i>’ (literally ‘Living Under Control’). Its basis lies in evidence-based treatment programs
               for suicidality, mainly Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT);

               </span>.
            </p>
            <p>The main goal of the program is helping participants decrease the frequency and intensity
               of their suicidal thoughts. Special attention is given to the often repetitive character
               of suicidal thoughts 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">43</span>
               </span>. As such, these thoughts are believed to be amenable to techniques found to be effective
               in reducing worry thoughts used in ‘Metacognitive Therapy for Worry and Generalised
               Anxiety Disorder’ 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">44</span>
               </span>. From a patient perspective, these techniques are easy to grasp, offer novelty to
               those who have had prior CBT treatment, and can be readily taught as part of self-help
               care.

               <h4>Structure</h4>
            </div>
            <p>The program consists of six modules, and participants are encouraged to complete one
               module per week. Ideally, they spend 30 minutes per day on the program. Each module
               contains four components: 1) theory, 2) a weekly assignment, 3) two to three recommended
               exercises, and 4) several optional exercises to help consolidate relevant information
               and skills. In addition, at the end of each module a number of Frequently Asked Questions
               (FAQs) are listed that participants can refer to at any time. Each module builds on
               previous modules and these become available in sequence, 4 days after starting the
               previous module. Completed modules remain available throughout the intervention. Finally,
               participants also have access to referral information via a ‘get-help-now’ button
               that is visible from every page. Participants are also informed that participation
               is not meant to replace treatment as usual and are therefore encouraged to seek further
               treatment (if they are not receiving this already).

               <h4>Content</h4>
            </div>
            <p>In the first module, similarities between suicidal thinking and worry are outlined.
               Core exercises are aimed at recognizing how often suicidal thoughts are repeated and
               learning to manage this repetitiveness better. The second module focuses on learning
               to tolerate and regulate intense emotions. The theory section explains how to recognize
               an upcoming crisis and taps into dealing with the urge to self-harm. Core exercises
               introduce different ways of coping with intense emotions, such as behavioral activation
               (for example, seeking distraction), and acceptance (waiting until the feelings subside).
               Participants are also encouraged to make a crisis plan. The third, fourth, and fifth
               modules deal with identifying automatic thoughts, recognizing common thinking patterns
               (for example, all or nothing thinking, overgeneralization, and mind reading), and
               cognitively restructuring the three most important identified negative automatic thoughts.
               The final module is dedicated to relapse prevention. It discusses the possibility
               of future setbacks and disappointments. Core exercises pertain to envisaging a realistic
               picture of the future, dealing with future setbacks, and recognizing and preventing
               relapse by making a relapse prevention plan.

         </div>
         <p>The attention-matched control condition uses a 6-week program that contains lifestyle
            information. This program follows a similar structure to the active program; that
            is, each module contains theory, a weekly assignment, several exercises, and a number
            of FAQs. Each module has a different topic: 1) nutrition, 2) a healthy home environment,
            3) a healthy weight, 4) a healthy heart, 5) a healthy skin, and 6) a healthy mouth.
            The program was designed so that no specific mental health information or suicide-related
            content was included. New modules become available 4 days after starting the previous
            module. Similar to the active program, participants in the Living Well program have
            access to referral information via a ‘get-help-now’ button that is visible from every
            page and are informed that participation is not meant to replace treatment they may
            already be receiving or the necessity to seek further treatment.

            </div>
            <p>In addition to the outcomes described above, several measures are included in the
               study to allow for cost-effectiveness analyses. Specifically, the Client Service Receipt
               Inventory (CSRI) is used to collect data on health care utilization 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">61</span>
               </span>. The CSRI can be tailored to suit data requirements, and in the current study the
               following domains will be captured: GP consultations, practice nurse visits, use of
               hospital services for physical problems, use of hospital services for mental health
               problems, mental health helpline contacts, psychiatric crisis support team contacts,
               social worker contacts, counseling contacts, therapy contacts, self-help group contacts,
               and psychiatrist contacts. In addition, the Short Form-12 (SF-12) 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">62</span>

            <h3>Safety of participants</h3>
         </div>
         <p>As this research is being conducted in a vulnerable, at-risk population, safety procedures
            were designed in collaboration with the Suicide Call Back Service (SCBS), which is
            an Australia-wide 24-hour service that provides telephone and online counseling to
            people 15 years and over who are suicidal, are bereaved by suicide, have a suicidal
            loved one, or are professionals working with suicidal clients. The goal was to design
            a procedure that would protect and assist participants while enabling them to maintain
            anonymity within the trial if they chose.
         </p>
         <p>To be able to enroll in the study, eligible participants will be required to contact
            the SCBS to obtain a unique code. They will be required to submit this code on their
            first login to the trial portal, before the participant is directed to the baseline
            questionnaire. This code subsequently enables researchers to identify the participant
            to the SCBS when needed (and vice versa), while not revealing the identity of the
            individual.
         </p>
         <p>On each measurement occasion (that is, 2 and 4 weeks into the program, the week 6
            post-test, 6-month follow-up and 12-month follow-up), the first three items of the
            ‘intensity of ideation’ section of the C-SSRS are used to detect high risk, defined
            as a score of 5 on any of these items. Whenever a participant meets this criterion,
            an automated email will prompt them to contact the SCBS. If they do not contact the
            SCBS within 2 days, an automated reminder will be sent. At the same time of this reminder,
            an automated email will be sent to the SCBS, which will contain the participant’s
            contact details if these were provided at registration. If no contact details were
            provided, the SCBS will take no further action; otherwise the SCBS will try to call
            the participant with a maximum of three attempts.
         </p>
         <p>These safety procedures were designed from the perspective that participants should
            be able to maintain their anonymity as much as possible considering ethical and clinical
            obligations and also should be allowed to remain autonomous in their decision to make
            contact with services as much as possible. This approach is consistent with the concept
            of self-help and patient empowerment.

            <h3>Sample size and power</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Power to detect change in suicidal thoughts is based on the expected effect of the
            intervention on the primary outcome measure. Based on the findings from the Dutch
            trial 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
            </span>, the expected effect size is 0.30 (Cohen’s d). To be able to detect this effect size,
            assuming a correlation between pre- and post-test measures of .5, including an expected
            drop-out rate of 30%, and allowing a width of about ± 0.20 for the confidence intervals
            of the effect size, 285 starters (expected to yield 200 completers) would be needed
            in each condition (with alpha = 0.05 and power of 0.80). The aim is therefore to recruit
            570 participants in the trial.

            drop-out (unless someone specifically requests to remove their data from the study).
            Available information from all participants will be retained using linear mixed models
            analyses. Transformation of variables will be done as necessary to meet distributional
            assumptions and to accommodate potential outlying observations. For other analyses,
            multiple imputation including demographic and other background variables will be used
            as necessary to allow inclusion of data from all participants.

            <h3>Data Safety Monitoring Board</h3>
         </div>
         <p>A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established for this study, consisting
            of two senior psychiatrists and one senior suicidologist. All members have extensive
            clinical and/or research experience with suicidal people. This DSMB is independent
            of all investigators and the funding agency, and no member of the DSMB has direct
            involvement in the conduct of the study. The DSMB will receive monthly reports from
            the trial manager detailing the number of participants contacting the SCBS and number
            of self-reported suicide attempts on completed follow-up questionnaires. Furthermore,
            the DSMB will be notified of any adverse events within 72 hours of knowledge of the
            event. The DSMB will also receive a report if there is any evidence suggesting potential
            risk to participants, for example, as detected by the trial manager or chief investigators.
            Finally, interim analyses will be performed once one-third of the total sample (that
            is, 190 participants) has reached 1) the 6-week post-test assessment, 2) the 6-month
            follow-up, and 3) the 12-month follow-up. The DSMB may recommend termination or modification
            of the study on the basis of any perceived safety concern based on their clinical
            judgment. This may include, but is not limited to, higher anticipated rates of primary
            safety indicators (suicidal ideation and attempted suicide, both assessed by self-report),
            or unexpected serious adverse events.

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>This paper describes the study protocol of a randomized controlled trial comparing
         a web-based self-help program for suicidal thoughts with an attention-matched program.
         This trial is a continuation of the first study that examined the effectiveness of
         web-based self-help for suicidal thoughts in the Netherlands 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
         </span> and is the first English-language RCT of this sort. The use of an attention-matched
         comparator condition, increased levels of participant anonymity, longer follow-up
         periods, and an improved look and feel of the program website improved the design
         of the study.
      </p>
      <p>This study will contribute to the growing body of evidence regarding the effectiveness
         of online suicide prevention. Currently, there is evidence indicating that a reduction
         in suicidal thoughts is associated with the use of web-interventions 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">15</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span>, and that the effect is greater than waitlist control condition 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
         </span>; but more research is needed to establish that programs targeting suicidal thoughts
         are more effective than wait lists. If effective, web-based self-help has the potential
         to be implemented and disseminated in a cost-effective way 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">66</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">68</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Limitations of this study include the potential for high drop-out, to which web-based
         self-help programs are often subject 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">69</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">70</span>
         </span> and may introduce selection bias. The anonymity of the participants will make it
         impossible to ascertain whether any suicides occur during the study. Similarly, the
         recording of suicide attempts relies solely on self-report and cannot be verified
         by objective records. Both these limitations are inherent to the self-help character
         of the trial and mimic real-life conditions if the program were to be implemented
         after the trial.
