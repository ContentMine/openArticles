                  <h3>Background</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) remain a common problem, with 40,000 new cases
                  in the United Kingdom each year and up to 250,000 in the United States. Traditional
                  management of MPE usually involves an inpatient stay with placement of a chest drain,
                  followed by the instillation of a pleural sclerosing agent such as talc, which aims
                  to minimise further fluid build-up. Despite a good success rate in studies, this approach
                  can be expensive, time-consuming and inconvenient for patients. More recently, an
                  alternative method has become available in the form of indwelling pleural catheters
                  (IPCs), which can be inserted and managed in an outpatient setting. It is currently
                  unknown whether combining talc pleurodesis with IPCs will provide improved pleural
                  symphysis rates over those of IPCs alone.

               </div>
               <p>IPC-PLUS is a patient-blind, multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing
                  the combination of talc with an IPC to the use of an IPC alone for inducing pleurodesis
                  in MPEs. The primary outcome is successful pleurodesis at five weeks post-randomisation.
                  This study will recruit 154 patients, with an interim analysis for efficacy after
                  100 patients, and aims to help to define the future gold standard for outpatient management
                  of patients with symptomatic MPEs.

               <p>IPC-PLUS is the first RCT to examine the practicality and utility of talc administered
                  via an IPC. The study remains in active recruitment and has the potential to significantly
                  alter how patients requiring pleurodesis for MPE are approached in the future.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) are a common complication of many cancers, with
         40,000 new cases in the United Kingdom each year and up to 250,000 in the United States
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. Their presence usually indicates metastatic disease, and hence possibly a poorer
         prognosis.
      </p>
      <p>The traditional management of MPE involves inpatient insertion of a chest drain, to
         ensure fluid drainage and pleural apposition, before the instillation of a sclerosant
         substance to cause pleural inflammation and adhesion, also known as pleurodesis. Many
         substances can be used as a pleural irritant, although by far the most commonly used
         worldwide is talc, which has been shown to be superior to numerous alternatives 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Quoted pleurodesis success rates are typically high with talc, ranging from 81 to
         100% 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>, although these figures may vary considerably in real-world practice due to differences
         between clinicians and between the practices of individual centres. To achieve such
         high efficacy, a patient typically requires admission for the insertion of a chest
         tube and drainage. Only once the pleural space is felt to be dry is the talc inserted.
         This usually requires an inpatient stay of five to seven days 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>, which can have a significant health economic impact, as well as the potential to
         impair the quality of remaining life for patients. Following the widespread use of
         large-particle talc, the side effects of pleurodesis have tended to be minor, the
         commonest of which are fever, pain and gastrointestinal upset 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>, although there have been rare cases of empyema 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>The main drawback of the traditional method of pleurodesis is the length of hospital
         stay and the inconvenience to patients. In more recent years, indwelling pleural catheters
         (IPCs) have become more widely used and may the potential to alleviate these problems.
      </p>
      <p>IPCs are silastic tubes, which have the potential to be left in place for weeks to
         months after being tunnelled under the skin. They can be inserted under local anaesthetic
         or at thoracoscopy, and are usually performed as a day case. Once at home, the aim
         is to drain fluid regularly (usually three times per week) in the patient’s own environment.
         This maximises the opportunity for pleural apposition and adhesion, which potentially
         leads to complete pleurodesis. Drainage can be performed by anyone with appropriate
         training, including the patient, but is often managed by district nursing teams.
      </p>
      <p>IPCs have been shown to be effective in the management of MPEs, although there is
         a paucity of evidence comparing them directly to talc pleurodesis. In a retrospective
         series of 250 cases, almost 90% of patients experienced complete or partial relief
         of dyspnoea 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>, a finding bettered in a later study in which all patients experienced improvement
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>. Indwelling drains have also been shown to improve other outcomes, such as length
         of hospital stay and future admissions, even in comparison to talc pleurodesis 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span>. Despite the need for proprietary drainage kits, they may also be cheaper overall
         to healthcare providers, if used for limited periods of time 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Regardless of patients’ short life expectancies, this is an achievable goal as IPCs
         can often be removed following sustained reduction in drainable fluid volumes, a reliable
         surrogate indicator for pleurodesis. Such spontaneous pleurodesis generally occurs
         in around 50% of cases 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span> and is heavily influenced by the underlying tumour type 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span>, although rates as high as 70% were reported in one study 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">15</span>
         </span>. The presence of ‘trapped lung’ (usually due to central airways obstruction or visceral
         pleural fibrosis) can lead to incomplete expansion following pleural fluid drainage,
         which no doubt influenced the variability of the time to pleurodesis in these studies.
         Indeed, in patients with trapped lung, the persistent failure of pleural apposition
         makes the achievement of any degree of pleurodesis much less likely overall, meaning
         regular fluid management with an IPC may be the only feasible approach to their care.
      </p>
      <p>However, IPCs are not without drawbacks. There may be significant pain associated
         with the immediate and short-term post-procedure period, and in some cases pleural
         tract metastases have been documented 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span>. Complications including empyema formation (3%), secondary fluid loculation (12%)
         and cellulitis (2%) have also been reported 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>. Nevertheless, meta-analysis data has shown IPCs are generally safe to use, with
         an overall complication rate of 12.5%.
      </p>
      <p>It would seem, therefore, that the optimal approach to the management of MPEs should
         be the combination of talc instillation, to achieve the highest pleurodesis rates
         and long-term fluid prevention, and placement of an IPC to allow greater convenience
         and quality of life for the patient. This should also theoretically lead to reduced
         overall healthcare costs when compared to either individual method. Despite the potential
         for combining fluid management approached being recognised in the literature, 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
         </span> there have been no studies to date to test this hypothesis, although ambulatory pleurodesis
         for malignant effusions was attempted in one small series by Saffran 
         <i>et al</i>. 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
         </span>. In this study, a closed-system pigtail catheter was inserted and pleurodesis was
         attempted at a later date using four grams of talc. Patients were managed as outpatients
         and the authors describe their method as being a viable alternative to traditional
         inpatient management. However, patient numbers were limited to 10 and there was no
         attempt at randomisation. The study took place before the widespread introduction
         of IPCs.
      </p>
      <p>The IPC-PLUS trial aims to test the hypothesis that the combination of talc in addition
         to IPCs is superior to IPCs alone in the management of MPEs. This trial has the potential
         to significantly affect, on a global scale, the way in which such effusions are managed
         in the future.

            <h3>Study questions</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Our primary research question is, ‘In patients with a proven MPE, does the use of
            talc as a sclerosant in conjunction with an IPC increase the number of patients achieving
            successful pleurodesis, when compared to using an IPC alone?’
         </p>
         <p>Our secondary research questions are as follows:</p>
         <p>1. Does using talc and an IPC together alter the amount of pain and breathlessness
            a patient experiences, when compared to using an IPC alone?
         </p>
         <p>2. Does the use of talc and an IPC together alter a patient’s quality of life, when
            compared to using an IPC alone?
         </p>
         <p>3. What are the medical complications of using talc in conjunction with an IPC?</p>
         <p>4. What are the logistical and clinical difficulties with using talc in conjunction
            with an IPC?
         </p>
         <p>5. Does the combination of talc and an IPC together influence the degree of fluid
            septation and loculation seen on thoracic ultrasound?
         </p>
         <p>6. Does the baseline level of serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) correlate with
            the volume of pleural fluid drained and chance of successful pleurodesis?
         </p>
         <p>7. Does pleural elastance during initial drainage correlate with lung entrapment and
            the chance of successful pleurodesis?
         </p>
         <p>8. Is using talc in combination with IPC cost-effective when compared to IPC alone?</p>
      </div>
      <div id="">
         <div tagx="st">
            <h3>Sample size and power calculation</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Talc pleurodesis alone has been shown to be up to 90% efficacious in trial conditions
            
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
            </span>, and we expect the combination of talc and IPC to be at least as effective as talc
            alone. IPCs used alone have a more variable range for pleurodesis efficacy, but suggest
            an average rate of around 50%.
         </p>
         <p>Therefore, in order to detect a 25% difference in pleurodesis success at five weeks
            (using conservative estimates of 60% IPC alone versus 85% IPC and talc) with 90% power,
            a 5% significance level and 5% loss to follow-up, we would require 154 patients (77
            in each arm). An interim analysis for efficacy will take place after 100 patients
            are randomised.

         </div>
         <p>Medicinal sterile talc as used in this trial is mined in Luzenac, France. It is marketed
            in the United Kingdom as Steritalc® and imported by GB UK Healthcare Ltd (Selby, UK).
            Talc is a naturally occurring mineral which, when processed for medical use as Steritalc,
            takes the form of a white powder of controlled particle size (graded). It is not licensed
            in the United Kingdom but is commonly used for the induction of pleurodesis, usually
            to prevent recurrence of MPEs or pneumothoraces. Medicinal talc has been licensed
            by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States since 2003. Prior to
            introduction into the pleural cavity it is reconstituted into slurry using an inert
            solvent such as 0.9% saline. The typical dose of talc is two to four grams. Common
            side effects following pleural administration of talc are mild pleuritic pain and
            low-grade fever.

         </div>
         <p>The IPC-PLUS study is a non-commercial, patient-blind, multicentre, randomised controlled
            trial of a medicinal product. Patients will be recruited from multiple centres within
            the United Kingdom. The trial is supported by the appropriate local and regional cancer
            networks.
         </p>
         <p>Clinical care, drain insertion and imaging will be provided by local medical professionals
            at the patients’ base hospitals or appropriate satellite centres. Further care will
            be provided by ward and specialist nurses in these centres, who will also be available
            for telephone support. Routine drainage of pleural fluid will take place in the community
            and at follow-up visits. All drainages up to the 28-day post-randomisation visit will
            be performed by appropriately trained medical staff such as district nurses, lung
            cancer specialist nurses or research nurses. After this, drainages may be performed
            by anyone who has been appropriately trained (except the patient themselves).

            <h3>Pre-randomisation</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Following consent, a baseline assessment will be undertaken by a member of the trial
            team and entered onto the appropriate case report form (CRF). This will include:
         </p>
         <p>1. Relevant medical history and physical examination, to include the onset and nature
            of symptoms, type of malignancy causing effusion (if known), pleural procedures to
            date, current ECOG/WHO performance status, current analgesia history and current and
            projected treatment plan outside of IPC-PLUS;
         </p>
         <p>2. Results of standard blood tests (from within 24 hours);</p>
         <p>3. Visual-Analogue Scale (VAS) score to assess thoracic pain and breathlessness;</p>
         <p>4. Quality of life assessment using EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) and Quality of Life Questionnaire
            C30 (QLQ-C30) health questionnaires;
         </p>
         <p>5. Chest X-ray, ideally posterior-anterior (from within previous 10 days) and</p>
         <p>6. Thoracic ultrasound scan.</p>
         <p>Patients will then be given an appointment, if this has not already been provided,
            to have an IPC (PleurX® catheter, CareFusion, IL, USA) inserted as a day case procedure
            within one week of the baseline assessment.
         </p>
         <p>IPCs must be placed by an appropriately trained member of staff, but not necessarily
            a member of the trial team. Immediately following drain placement, a therapeutic aspiration
            should be performed. During drainage, patients should have pleural pressures measured
            after every 100 to 200 mls of fluid removed, using a calibrated electronic pleural
            manometer (Mirador Biomedical, Seattle, WA, USA). Pressure measurements should be
            recorded along with the total volume removed. A chest X-ray should be performed post-procedure
            to confirm adequate drain placement.
         </p>
         <p>Prior to discharge, the patient will be issued with a drainage booklet which will
            act as a record for the volumes of fluid drained throughout their period of trial
            participation. They will also be given a chart on which they can complete their own
            VAS scores for pain and breathlessness, which should be done on a daily basis.
         </p>
         <p>For the period post IPC insertion and before their randomisation visit, patients should
            have their fluid drained on at least five occasions, the initial drainage being immediately
            after IPC insertion prior to discharge. This first drainage may be to the maximum
            clinically appropriate volume, with subsequent drainages to a maximum of 1,000 mls
            per drainage. The patient’s fifth drainage can take place as part of their randomisation
            visit.
         </p>
         <p>Patients will attend their local trial centre 10 days (+/− one day, as above) after
            IPC insertion. Their pleural space should be drained to dryness, or as close to dryness
            as allowed by symptoms. Following this, they should undergo a chest X-ray (ideally
            posterior-anterior) and have an appointment with a member of the trial team, who will
            perform a standardised medical assessment. Quality of life will be assessed using
            the EQ-5D and QLQ-C30 questionnaires. The chest X-ray should be examined for evidence
            of lung entrapment and significant fluid. A thoracic ultrasound of the side where
            the IPC has been inserted should be performed, looking for evidence of fluid loculation
            and septation.
         </p>
         <p>If there is evidence of significant lung entrapment (defined as &gt;25% of the hemithorax
            without expanded lung visible on a chest X-ray, as judged by two separate clinicians)
            or significant pleural fluid (defined as pleural fluid, confirmed on thoracic ultrasound,
            occupying more than one third of the hemithorax as judged by two separate clinicians
            using visual estimation on a chest X-ray), then the patient should be excluded from
            randomisation. Patients who do not meet the criteria for randomisation should have
            their on-going care devolved to the appropriate local services. Patients may also
            be excluded for other clinical reasons not relating to the degree of lung entrapment
            or residual fluid. If a patient is eligible for trial continuation at this point then
            they should be randomised at the same visit and given the allocated treatment substance
            before returning home.

            <h3>Randomisation, blinding and emergency unblinding</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Those who are eligible for will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either receive
            intrapleural talc slurry (4 g Novatech Steritalc mixed with 50 mls 0.9% saline) via
            the IPC, or to receive a placebo instillation of 0.9% sterile saline alone.
         </p>
         <p>Treatment allocation will be performed by an independent computer randomisation service,
            which will be accessed by the main trial coordination centre on behalf of recruitment
            centres following confirmation of suitability for randomisation. Minimisation with
            a random component will be used 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
            </span>.
         </p>
         <p>The minimisation factors are:</p>
         <p>1. Volume of pleural fluid removed in the first 10 days post IPC (≤1,999 mls or ≥2,000
            mls),
         </p>
         <p>2. Malignancy subtype (ovarian and breast, mesothelioma or other), and</p>
         <p>3. Day 10 chest X-ray appearance (expanded with no evidence of trapped lung or evidence
            of trapped lung but fits the criteria for randomisation).
         </p>
         <p>The study is to be performed in a single blind fashion. Patients are to be kept unaware
            of their treatment allocation, but the physician and other healthcare professionals
            involved with administering the slurry or placebo are made aware of the allocation.
            A number of methods are to be used to reduce the likelihood of a patient learning
            of their allocation. These include:
         </p>
         <p>1. Making the randomisation phone call in a separate room to the patient,</p>
         <p>2. Preparing the slurry or placebo in a separate room to the patient and ensuring
            materials are covered before the patient is brought in,
         </p>
         <p>3. Opaque syringes being used to make it less clear which substance is being administered
            and
         </p>
         <p>4. The slurry or placebo being administered from behind the patient, with the patient
            facing forward.
         </p>
         <p>Patients may have their treatment allocation revealed (unblinded) at any time according
            to clinical need. A 24-hour telephone number will be available for unblinding queries.

            <h3>Post-randomisation</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The administration of the randomised substance should be followed by an adequate flush
            to ensure as little as possible is left in the IPC line. Patients should then be observed
            for a minimum of two hours before being discharged home. Observations should include
            at least half-hourly measurements of pulse, blood pressure, temperature, pain score
            and respiratory rate. Patients must have their first post-randomisation drainage between
            12 and 36 hours after instillation, and early communication with community nursing
            teams is vital to ensure this takes place.

         <p>Following randomisation, all patients should receive fluid drainage in the community,

            be done by an appropriately trained healthcare professional up to and including the
            day 28 follow-up visit. After this, until the end of the trial follow-up period, drainages
            may be performed by anyone with an appropriate level of training. This may include
            the patient’s family or carers, but should not be the patient themselves. The frequency
            of drainage will be at the discretion of the patient and community team, but should
            occur at least twice per week, and should begin at three times per week. Drainage
            volumes will be recorded on each occasion.

               <h4>Primary endpoint</h4>
            </div>
            <p>The primary endpoint is the number of patients with successful pleurodesis at 5 weeks
               post-randomisation. For the primary outcome measure, successful pleurodesis will be
               defined as the collection of less than, or equal to, 50 mls of pleural fluid on three
               consecutive occasions, with chest opacification on the side of the IPC less than 25%,
               as judged by two independent clinicians, who should be blind to treatment allocation.
               Information on drainage volumes will be collected in the community and during follow-up
               visits as described above. The X-ray for chest opacification must have been taken
               after the third consecutive occasion of collection of less than 50 mls of fluid, and
               within the 10-week follow-up period. All three occasions of collection of less than
               50 mls of fluid should also occur within the 10-week follow-up period.
            </p>
            <p>Patients who drain less than 50 mls of fluid on three or more occasions but who continue
               to have greater than 25% pleural opacification on a chest X-ray due to pleural fluid
               (as proven by thoracic ultrasound), will be defined as having an unsuccessful pleurodesis.
               If there is a clinical suspicion that the drain may be blocked then appropriate attempts
               to resolve this should be made prior to a definition being made.
            </p>
            <p>The achievement of pleurodesis should be dated to the first drainage of less than
               or equal to 50 mls. Even if patients achieve the requirements for pleurodesis during
               the trial period, they will continue to receive fortnightly follow-up visits as originally
               planned until the 70-day follow-up period is complete.
            </p>
            <p>Patients who die during the 10-week trial period will be assessed for whether they
               achieved pleurodesis success prior to death. This requires the collection of less
               than, or equal to, 50 mls of pleural fluid on three consecutive occasions, with chest
               opacification on the side of the IPC less than 25%, as judged by two independent clinicians,
               who should be blind to treatment allocation, with the X-ray having been taken after
               the third consecutive collection volume of less than 50 mls.

               <h4>Secondary endpoints</h4>
            </div>
            <p>The secondary endpoints for this trial are as follows:</p>
            <p>1. Self-reported quality of life status, measured at 14, 28, 42, 56 and 70 days, using
               the EQ-5D and QLQ-C30 health questionnaires.
            </p>
            <p>2. Self-reported VAS scores, measured daily from randomisation to 10 weeks post-randomisation,
               for thoracic pain and breathlessness.
            </p>
            <p>3. Total volume of pleural fluid drained from randomisation to 10 weeks post-randomisation.</p>
            <p>4. All-cause mortality up to 10 weeks post-randomisation.</p>
            <p>5. Number of hospital inpatient bed-days required from randomisation to 10 weeks post-randomisation.</p>
            <p>6. Degree of loculation of pleural fluid following talc instillation as judged by
               thoracic ultrasound and septation score at two-weekly intervals for the 10-week follow-up
               period.
            </p>
            <p>7. Pleurodesis success at 10 weeks post-randomisation, as defined by consecutive fluid
               volume measurement.
            </p>
            <p>8. Number of pleural procedures to relieve pleural fluid, excluding IPC drainage,
               from randomisation to up to 10 weeks.
            </p>
            <p>9. Pleurodesis success at five and 10 weeks post-randomisation, as defined by total
               volume of fluid collected over two consecutive weeks.
            </p>
            <p>As part of a secondary analysis, patients who have recorded drainages of less than
               or equal to a total of 250 mls of fluid over two consecutive weeks during their follow-up
               period (with appropriate radiological findings) will also be defined as having a successful
               pleurodesis. The period of two consecutive weeks may begin with any drainage which
               is undertaken during the post-randomisation trial period, and ends two weeks later
               on the same day of the week. The drainage volume recorded on this final day is included
               in the total volume for the two-week period. Patients must be drained no less frequently
               than twice per week.
            </p>
            <p>In order to be defined as having a successful pleurodesis, a patient’s chest X-ray
               must have chest opacification on the side of the IPC of less than 25%, as judged by
               two independent clinicians, who should be blind to treatment allocation. The X-ray
               for chest opacification must have been taken after the last drainage of the two-week
               period, and within the overall 10-week follow-up period.
            </p>
            <p>For patients who successfully drain less than or equal to 250 mls of fluid in a two-week
               period, the date of pleurodesis is defined as the day of the first drainage in that
               period. All drainages which count towards the total volume must occur within the study
               period.
            </p>
            <p>Patients who die during the follow-up period will also be assessed for pleurodesis
               using measurements collected prior to death. The clinical and radiological parameters
               used to define successful pleurodesis by volume over time remain the same as those
               described above.

            <p>In addition to the primary and secondary endpoints above, the trial will generate
               data to inform further sub-studies. These will relate to the trial questions which
               are not directly linked to the pleurodesis efficacy of talc, and the details of their
               analysis are beyond the scope of this protocol. Sub-studies will include the following:
            </p>
            <p>1. Examining whether the measurement of pleural elastance can be used to predict lung
               entrapment (pleural manometry).
            </p>
            <p>2. Examining whether serum levels of NT-pro BNP at baseline are related to pleurodesis
               success.
            </p>
            <p>3. Health economic analysis: the perspective adopted in the economic analysis will
               be that of the English National Health Service and Social Services. As a result we
               will collect information on the following resource use items:
            </p>
            <p>a. Intervention costs: This will entail collecting information on talc, consumables
               and staff time. This information will be obtained by reviewing hospital records. Should
               a significant between-group difference in the rates of IPC blockage and drain removal
               occur, these will also be included in the intervention cost analysis.
            </p>
            <p>b. Follow-up costs: This will entail collecting information on patients’ use of hospital
               resources after randomisation. Information collected will include inpatient stays,
               outpatient services, use of emergency departments and ambulance costs. Information
               on inpatient stays will be obtained by reviewing the administrative care records in

            The team is responsible for all aspects of the project (such as recruitment rate,
            budget management, protocol adherence and so forth) and for ensuring appropriate action
            is taken to safeguard trial participants and the quality of the study. The Respiratory
            Research Unit at NBT will have responsibility for authorisation, good clinical practice
            (GCP) and conduct, data integrity, data checking and database integrity.
         </p>
         <p>The Trial Steering Committee consists of both independent members as well as researchers
            working on the trial. The role of the Trial Steering Committee is to provide overall
            supervision of the study and monitor the progress of the trial to ensure that it is
            being conducted in accordance with the protocol, relevant regulations and the principles

            <h3>Safety reporting</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Standard definitions and medical judgement will be used for the identification of
            adverse events, adverse reactions, the expectedness and seriousness of these events
            and any potential relationship to a trial intervention. Due to the population of patients
            involved in the IPC-PLUS trial, a high number of adverse events are to be expected.
            Many of these will not be related to the investigational medicinal product administration
            or trial-related procedures, but will be as a direct consequence of the patient’s
            underlying malignancy. Other events may occur as a result of a trial-related intervention,
            but are well-documented and regarded as normal reactions in the context of talc administration.
            Expected adverse events in these settings are:
         </p>
         <p>1. Death due to underlying malignancy;</p>
         <p>2. Admission due to underlying malignancy;</p>
         <p>3. New fever after instillation of slurry or placebo (≥38°C);</p>
         <p>4. New mild tachycardia after instillation of slurry or placebo(≥20 beats per minute
            over baseline);
         </p>
         <p>5. New pleuritic chest pain after instillation of slurry or placebo, requiring simple
            analgesia (simple analgesia is defined as any medication which is not a morphine derivative
            or equivalent);
         </p>
         <p>6. New tachypnoea after instillation of slurry or placebo (increase in respiratory
            rate of five or more breaths per minute over baseline) and
         </p>
         <p>7. New hypoxia after instillation of slurry or placebo (to saturation of ≤92% on air,
            or to a level requiring additional supplemental oxygen).
         </p>
         <p>If any doubt in the causality of an event exists the local investigator should inform
            the trial coordinator who will notify the chief investigator. Pharmaceutical companies
            and/or other clinicians may be asked to advise in some cases. In the case of discrepant
            views on causality between the local investigator and others, all parties will discuss
            the case. In the event that no agreement is made, the MHRA will be informed of both
            points of view.

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The IPC-PLUS trial is a multicentre, randomised controlled trial which has the potential
         to significantly affect how patients with malignant pleural disease are treated. Although
         the TIME2 study published by Davies 
         <i>et al</i>. suggested that first-line therapy for MPE might include IPCs 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>, they are currently viewed by many practitioners as predominantly a second-line treatment
         in those patients who have not had success with a talc pleurodesis.
      </p>
      <p>The combination of talc and an IPC has been used in anecdotal reports, but this is
         the first study to examine its utility in a robust way. Theoretically, the addition
         of talc to an IPC should allow for pleurodesis rates similar to that seen in bedside
         slurry to be maintained, but with the added benefit of outpatient management. This
         approach is likely to be applicable to a wide range of patients, including those with
         shorter life expectancies, those who want to minimise the duration of an IPC being
         in place or to those who have a strong preference for talc therapy but do not want
         to spend time in hospital. Given both the increasing use of IPCs worldwide and the
         availability of talc as a sclerosing agent, a positive trial outcome will likely have
         a global impact. A negative trial outcome, or if it is shown that the addition of
         talc via an IPC is detrimental to patients, would still be useful information as there
         remains a dearth of knowledge regarding this important population of patients.

         <h2>Trial status</h2>
      </div>
      <p>IPC-PLUS gained REC approval in May 2012 and MHRA approval in June 2012. The first
         recruitment site gained local approval in July 2012 and opened shortly after. There
         are currently 16 active recruitment sites in the United Kingdom, with a further three
         sites in the set-up phase. Recruitment will only begin at future sites once all necessary
         local approvals have been granted. As of July 2014, the study has enrolled 98 patients
         with 60 randomisations. The trial is due to complete in May 2015.
