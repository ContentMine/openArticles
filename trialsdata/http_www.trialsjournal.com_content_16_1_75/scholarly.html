               <h2>Abstract</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Effective recruitment is central to successful trials but is often problematic. This
               article reports the lessons learnt while recruiting stroke rehabilitation patients
               to a multi-centre randomised control trial. As intended, 94 participants were recruited
               from 12 inpatient stroke rehabilitation services in Northwest England over 12 months;
               however, recruitment rates were highly varied (from 0.6 to 2.5 participants per site
               per month) as were the nature of the stroke services and the personnel available.
               Consequently, bespoke recruitment procedures were needed at each site. As the assessment
               skills needed to screen for the selection criteria were specific to therapists, our
               most common strategy was for the hospital therapists to screen patients and make referrals
               directly to the trial team. However, we identified several strategies undertaken by
               the research nurse in the highest recruiting site that appeared to positively impact
               on recruitment. These strategies included involving the whole multidisciplinary team,
               being part of the stroke team, facilitating contact between the clinical and trial
               teams and using inclusive recruitment and watchful waiting strategies.
            </p>
            <p>Rehabilitation trials frequently require skilled assessments by therapists, rather
               than by doctors or nurses to identify potential participants. Thus, research support
               models need to include suitably skilled trial therapists. Recruitment can be enhanced
               by enthusiastic, regular and structured engagement with the entire stroke multidisciplinary
               team and by using inclusive recruitment and ‘watchful waiting’ strategies to identify
               and monitor potential participants.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the standard criterion for assessing healthcare
         interventions, but effective recruitment is required to maintain statistical power,
         ensure external validity and prevent unnecessary costs and delays. This is a challenge
         that few trials overcome 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. There is a growing body of literature highlighting these difficulties and suggesting
         solutions in different settings and clinical groups, although strategies for best
         practice are yet to be established 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>

         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>As stroke rehabilitation trialists, we need to know how best to recruit eligible participants,
         whether from inpatient stroke units or following discharge to community settings.
         Inclusion criteria for rehabilitation trials tend to include objective measures of
         activity limitations (for example, walking speed) or enduring impairments (for example,
         arm weakness), as well as clinical diagnosis. Such information is rarely recorded
         in medical records, which mean conventional recruitment techniques, such as screening
         case notes are ineffective.
      </p>
      <p>Here we report the lessons learnt from a stroke-rehabilitation RCT on effective recruitment
         strategies. We aimed to recruit 90 patients over a 12-month period for randomisation
         to a trial where they would receive 4 weeks of patient-led upper limb mirror therapy
         or lower limb exercises (the attentional control) in 12 inpatient stroke-rehabilitation
         units in Northwest England. Ethical approval was provided by Lancaster National Research
         Ethics Committee (Registration number 10/H1015/85). All participants gave informed
         consent.

         <h2>Main text</h2>
      </div>
      <p>We based our expected recruitment rate (one participant per site per month) on service
         activity records, our experience of previous studies in the participating hospitals,
         and published data regarding the frequency of impairments and activity limitations
         after stroke. Stroke Research Network staff identified potential participants from
         stroke unit admission data, screened against eligibility criteria (with the help of
         stroke therapists, if necessary), and referred eligible patients to the trial team,
         whose members would seek consent and then perform baseline assessments before randomisation.
      </p>
      <p>Although all sites were able to recruit, recruitment rates differed markedly, ranging
         from 0.6 to 2.5 participants per site per month (Table 
         <span tagx="tblr">1</span>), making it difficult to predict recruitment potential for this, or future trials.
         The size, nature and organisation of the stroke services and staff skill mix were
         also highly varied, as were the personalities involved and the team climate within
         the service. There was no obvious organisational or clinical explanation for the variability
         in recruitment rate, and in effect, a bespoke strategy needed to be developed at each
         site.

      <p>The clinical teams’ research experience, skills and enthusiasm, and the research network
         staff’s clinical and assessment skills impacted strongly on the tasks that individuals
         could be asked to perform. In most cases, the research network staff did not have
         the assessment skills to screen for potential participants, as these assessments are
         usually the domain of stroke therapists. Consequently, our most common strategy was
         for the hospital therapists to screen patients and then liaise directly with the trial
         team. Research network staff’s confidence to extend their sphere of influence by engaging
         with the stroke therapists varied. Again, in some instances, the solution was for
         the trial team to work directly and build a relationship with the clinicians.
      </p>
      <p>One site (Site 4, Table 
         <span tagx="tblr">1</span>) had a notably higher recruitment rate than the other sites throughout the trial,
         recruiting 25% of all participants. During informal discussions with the clinicians
         and research nurses at this site (and others), we identified several differences in
         approach used by the research network nurse in Site 4, which appeared to positively
         impact the recruitment rate. These are detailed below.
      </p>
      <div id="">
         <div tagx="st">
            <h3>Clinician-related strategies</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The research nurse at Site 4 ensured she had a good knowledge of the whole stroke
            service (rather than focussing on admissions), built an effective working relationship
            with all members of the multidisciplinary stroke team (rather than just the principal
            investigator and research staff) and was perceived as part of the team by being seen
            on the ward daily and assisting when appropriate. This made involvement in research
            and recruitment a role for all team members She gave frequent briefings; held regular,
            structured liaison meetings with the team regarding recruitment rates and progress
            of the trial; and kept a ‘research board’ on the ward up-to-date with progress. She
            also facilitated on-going contact between the clinical and trial teams. This helped
            the clinical team maintain their attention on recruitment and better understand the
            trial and their role, which created a sense of allegiance to the trial.

      <div id="">
         <div tagx="st">
            <h3>Patient-related strategies</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The research nurse at Site 4 took a more inclusive approach than most. It was her
            view that, wherever possible, participation should be the patients’, rather than the
            healthcare professionals’ choice. She viewed all patients as potential participants
            unless/until there was an overwhelming reason for why they should not be considered,
            rather than excluding on potential reasons. If in doubt, she discussed it with the
            principal investigator, trial team or offered the trial to the patient so they could
            make the choice. The trial’s service user consultation group was fully supportive
            of this approach, expressing dismay at the notion of ‘gate-keeping’ and ‘cherry-picking’.
         </p>
         <p>Like many rehabilitation trials, the nature of our selection criteria meant patients
            who were unsuitable to participate early after their stroke may become eligible at
            a later stage. A ‘watchful waiting’ strategy (that is, monitoring patients’ progress
            and approaching them if/when they improved or their condition changed) required meticulous
            record keeping and ongoing discussions within the multidisciplinary team, but enabled
            many more suitable potential participants to be identified in the post-acute stage
            of stroke.
         </p>
         <p>At the other recruitment sites, these strategies were adopted to some degree. Site
            12 (Table 
            <span tagx="tblr">1</span>) was the last site to start recruiting, due to long delays obtaining approvals, and
            adopted the strategies described above with similar success, albeit only for a short
            period.
         </p>
         <p>To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper to specifically explore recruitment
            to inpatient rehabilitation trials involving a multidisciplinary stroke team; the
            findings and solutions may be generalisable to rehabilitation trials in other clinical
            groups. We found that recruitment to rehabilitation trials requires assessment skills
            that are beyond the scope of most nurses and many doctors, and information is rarely
            available in clinical notes. Thus, research support needs to ensure a workforce with
            a suitable skill mix. Like rehabilitation trialists in other settings 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
            </span>, we felt this support could be most effectively and efficiently provided by dedicated
            research therapists working across the research sites rather than generic staff working
            on multiple trials at a single site.
         </p>
         <p>Perhaps our most striking finding is that a few apparently simple, no-cost strategies
            appeared to positively affect recruitment rates. An inclusive recruitment strategy,
            ‘watchful waiting’, and a close relationship between the research nurse and the clinical
            team achieved a recruitment rate in Site 4 that was twice as high as the average for
            the trial. If this observation could be generalised, there is potential to dramatically
            reduce the cost and duration of clinical trials and the time scale that will impact
            clinical practice. However, we fully acknowledge the limitations of the narrative
            nature of this report, which merely indicates that further research is warranted.
         </p>
         <p>There are clear parallels between the challenges of rehabilitation trials and other
            complex interventions, such as surgery and oncology, where research has tended to
            focus on patient- and design-related factors 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
            </span>-
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
            </span>. Recently, Donovan 
            <i>et al</i>. 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
            </span> explored staff-related issues, describing how staff’s clinical and professional priorities,
            responsibilities and beliefs can inadvertently contribute to recruitment difficulties.
            Our experience supports these findings and adds to them by suggesting that simple
            changes to operational processes may enhance recruitment rates. Like Donovan 
            <i>et al</i>. 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
            </span>, we recommend support and training to enable staff to develop skills and confidence.
            In our experience, mere dissemination and discussion highlighting the potential benefits
            of these processes and how they can be achieved is largely ineffective.

         <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Recruitment to rehabilitation trials often requires therapists’ assessment skills
         rather than those provided by doctors or nurses, which, in turn, necessitate a flexible
         research support workforce, including dedicated trial therapists. Recruitment can
         be further enhanced by engaging the multidisciplinary stroke team, and using inclusive
         recruitment and ‘watchful waiting’ strategies to identify and monitor potential participants.
