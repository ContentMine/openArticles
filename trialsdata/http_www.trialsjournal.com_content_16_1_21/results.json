      "The position of arterial ligation during laparoscopic anterior rectal resection with total mesorectal excision can affect genito-urinary function, bowel function, oncological outcomes, and the incidence of anastomotic leakage. Ligation to the inferior mesenteric artery at the origin or preservation of the left colic artery are both widely performed in rectal surgery. The aim of this study is to compare the incidence of genito-urinary dysfunction, anastomotic leak and oncological outcomes in laparoscopic anterior rectal resection with total mesorectal excision with high or low ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery in a controlled randomized trial."
