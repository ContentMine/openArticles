               </div>
               <p>Outcome reporting bias has received widespread recognition and been considered to
                  pose two threats to the validity of clinical decision making because they overestimate
                  the effect of treatments or distort the results of trials. However, the problem of
                  outcome-reporting bias has not been systematically studied among randomized clinical
                  trials of acupuncture. Our objectives were to evaluate the consistency between the
                  registered records and subsequent publications with respect to outcomes and other
                  data as well as to determine whether outcome-reporting bias favors significant primary
                  outcomes.

                  <h3>Methods</h3>
               </div>
               <p>A systematic search of 15 registries was conducted from their inception to January
                  2014 to identify randomized clinical trials on acupuncture for which the status was
                  listed as ‘completed.’ The subsequent publications were retrieved by searching PubMed
                  and three Chinese databases. Basic characteristics and the registration information
                  were extracted from the registered records and publications. We performed comparisons
                  regarding primary outcomes and other data between the registered records and subsequent
                  publications to assess the consistency and selective outcome reporting.

                  <h3>Results</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Eighty-eight trials on acupuncture with 96 published reports were identified. Only
                  19.3% (17/88) were registered before the start of the trial, suggesting prospective
                  registration. The trial registration number was unavailable in 36 published reports
                  (37.5%). A comparison of registered and published primary outcomes could be conducted
                  in 71 publications (74.0%), and the inconsistency of the primary outcomes was identified
                  in 45.1% (32 of 71); 71.4% (15 of 21) had a discrepancy that favored statistically
                  significant primary outcomes, while 28.6% (6 of 21) favored nonsignificant primary
                  outcomes. Furthermore, the other inconsistencies between the registry records and
                  subsequent publications involved the inclusion criteria (54.7%), exclusion criteria
                  (47.9%) and controls (22.9%).

                  <h3>Conclusions</h3>
               </div>
               <p>We find that prospective registration for randomized clinical trials on acupuncture
                  is insufficient, selective outcome reporting is prevalent, and the change of primary
                  outcomes is intended to favor statistical significance. These discrepancies in outcome
                  reporting may lead to biased and misleading results of randomized clinical trials
                  on acupuncture. To ensure publication of reliable and unbiased results, further promotion
                  and implementation of trial registration are still needed.

      <p>Outcome reporting bias in a clinical study is defined as the selection of a subset
         of the original variables recorded on the basis of the significance and direction
         of the results 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. It distorts the results of trials and leads to a reduction in the strength of evidence

      <p>Prospectively trial registration in international clinical trial registries before
         participant enrollment is one of the main ways to potentially reduce selective outcome
         reporting and further outcome reporting bias 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>

            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) announced a policy
         of requiring investigators to register clinical trials in a clinical trial registry
         before participant enrollment as a prerequisite for publication in 2004. This policy
         took effect in 2005 and is applicable to any clinical trial beginning enrollment after
         1 July 2005 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>. The World Health Organization formally established the International Clinical Trials
         Registry Platform (ICTRP; 
         <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/">http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/</a>) in 2004 to push for clinical trial registration. Furthermore, several peer-reviewed
         journals, such as 
         <i>The Lancet</i> and 
         <i>Trials</i>, publish study protocols to achieve transparency regarding performance and reporting
         of clinical trials.

      <p>Outcome reporting bias has received much attention. Many empirical studies evaluating
         the consistency concerning outcomes between the protocol or trial registry entry of
         randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and subsequent publications have demonstrated that
         outcome reporting bias is prevalent and favors statistically significant results

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span>. A recent study focusing on RCTs of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) showed discrepancies
         were identified in primary outcomes (29%) and safety reporting (28%) when comparing
         registered records with their subsequent publications 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>

         </div>
         <p>A systematic search of 15 major international trial registries was conducted using
            the search terms “acupuncture” or “electroacupuncture” or “auriculotherapy” from their
            inception to January 2014. Trial registries included the Australian New Zealand Clinical
            Trials Registry (ANZCTR), Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry (ReBec), Chinese Clinical
            Trial Register (ChiCTR), Clinical Research Information Service (CRiS) public of Korea
            (KCT), ClinicalTrials.gov, Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI), Cuban Public Registry
            of Clinical Trials (RPCEC), EU Clinical Trials Register (EU-CTR), German Clinical
            Trials Register (DRKS), International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number
            Register (ISRCTN), Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT), Japan Primary Registries
            Network (JPRN), Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR), the Netherlands National
            Trial Register (NTR), and Sri Lanka Clinical Trials Registry (SLCTR). If trials were
            listed as ‘completed’ in the registered records, the full texts of subsequently published
            articles were retrieved by searching PubMed without a language limit and three Chinese
            electronic bibliographic databases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure
            (
            <a href="http://www.cnki.net">http://www.cnki.net</a>), Chinese Biomedical Database (

            Identified articles were checked against the target registered records to determine
            whether they were a correct match. For each trial, all published articles reporting
            the final results were included. Abstracts and reports of preliminary results were

         <p>Two authors (Su CX, Han M, Ren J, or Li WY) independently extracted data using a standardized,
            piloted data extraction form. The form was modified based on the previous research
            
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
            </span>. We collected the following information reported in trial registries and published
            articles: trial design, sample size, participants and diseases/conditions, interventions,
            controls, primary and secondary outcomes along with the time frame of assessment,
            inclusion and exclusion criteria, and funding. For each registered trial, we also
            extracted the date registered, start and end dates of participant enrollment/the trial,
            sponsors, and country of origin. Publication year and language, journal name, registered
            number, and 
            <i>P</i> values for all the outcomes were also extracted from each subsequently published
            report. The 2013 impact factor of journals where registered trials were published
            was sought. ‘Instructions for authors’ of the included journals was checked for whether
            the registration of the trial and reporting of the trial’s registration number were
            required in the published report. The “history of changes” in the registries was tracked
            to determine whether the registered information had been changed since the initial
            registration. Conditions were classified according to International Statistical Classification
            of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10

         <p>Methodological quality of registered records and subsequent publications was assessed
            independently by two authors (Su CX, Ren J, or Li WY) using the Cochrane Collaboration
            risk of bias tool, which included generation of the allocation sequence, allocation

            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
            </span>. Other risk of bias was assessed based on the estimated sample size, explicit inclusion
            and exclusion criteria, and the risk of funding bias.
         </p>
         <p>Two authors (Su CX, Ren J, or Li WY) evaluated the consistency and selective outcome
            reporting regarding the trial design, methodology, and outcomes from the registered
            records and subsequently published articles. The disagreements were resolved by consensus
            with a third party (Liu JP). We defined inconsistency as “when the items in the trial
            registry were not the same as those in the subsequent publications”

      <p>Of 860 registered acupuncture trials retrieved, 399 indicated their current status
         as ‘completed’. After excluding 160 registered trials because of duplicates or being
         non-RCTs, non-acupuncture and phase I, we searched subsequent publications for 88
         of the 239 registered trials (36.8%). The 88 trials produced 96 publications reporting
         study outcomes, among which all publications were in English (Figure 
         <div tagx="figr">1</div>).

      <p>Of the 88 included trial protocols, 65 (73.9%; 72 articles) were from western countries;
         23 (26.1%; 24 articles) were from eastern countries, of which only 7 were performed
         in mainland China (excluding Hong Kong and Taiwan). The included trial protocols were
         registered in eight registries and the majority was registered in either clinicaltrials.gov
         (43/88, 48.9%) or ISRCTN (36/88, 40.9%). The first trial was registered in 2001. Only
         19.3% (17/88) were registered before the start of the trial, suggesting prospective
         registration. The remaining 71 trials were registered after the study began, even
         after the completion of the study. The proportion of retrospective registration was
         similar for trials from western countries (54/65, 83.1%) and eastern countries (17/23,
         73.9%; 
         <i>P</i> = 0.33). When comparing trials starting before 1 July 2005 (36/40, 90.0%), the proportion
         of retrospective registration was higher than that in trials starting after 1 July
         2005 (35/48, 72.9%; 
         <i>P</i> = 0.04).

      <p>Ninety-six articles were published in 49 journals from 1997 to 2014 (Figure 
         <div tagx="figr">2</div>). Seven (7.3%) were published in alternative and complementary journals. Sixteen
         (16.7%) were published in journals whose 2013 impact factor was high than 10 (Additional
         file 
         <div tagx="supplr">1</div>: Table S1). Twenty-seven journals (48 articles; 50.0%) provided guidance on trial
         registration and reporting of the registration number in their instructions for the
         author. Of 36 articles (37.5%) without description of the registration number, 50.0%
         (18/36) were published in journals requiring the reporting of the registration number.

         (55, 57.3%), two armed (59, 61.5%), and sponsored by a university, government or hospital
         (77, 80.2%). The five most frequent conditions based on ICD-10 were musculoskeletal
         (26.1%), nervous (19.3%), mental and behavioral disorders (17.0%), respiratory conditions
         (5.7%) and neoplasms (5.7%; Table 
         <span tagx="tblr">2</span>). Manual acupuncture and electro-acupuncture were reported in 80 (83.3%) and 16 (16.7%)
         articles, respectively. Interventions in the treatment groups involved acupuncture
         alone in 70 (72.9%) articles or acupuncture combined with other interventions in 26
         (27.1%) articles. There was considerable variation in the control group. Fifty-one
         articles (53.1%) applied sham/placebo acupuncture; other commonly used controls involved
         western medicine (26.0%), no intervention (9.4%) and non-pharmaceutical interventions
         (9.4%). A clear description of the primary outcome and secondary outcome was provided
         in 71 (74.0%) and 60 articles (62.5%), respectively. However, safety and health-economic
         outcomes were only reported in 38 (39.6%) and 5 articles (5.2%), respectively.

      <p>Seventy-five subsequent publications (78.1%) provided detailed information on the
         generation of allocation sequences with the most use of a computer random number generator.
         Fifty-eight articles (60.4%) provided details on allocation concealment. Of 69 articles
         (71.9%) providing information on blinding, 37 applied single blinding, 28 double blinding,
         and 4 triple blinding. However, only 3.4% (3/88), 2.3% (2/88) and 61.4% (54/88) of
         the registered records provided information on the generation of an allocation sequence,
         allocation concealment and blinding, respectively. Incomplete outcome reporting occurred
         in 33 (34.4%) articles. The sample size of the 96 articles ranged from 10 (pilot trials)
         to 960, with the majority (88.6%) of sample sizes between 20 and 500 per trial (Additional
         file 
         <div tagx="supplr">2</div>: Table S2). Only 34 articles (35.4%) carried out a sample size calculation. All registered
         records lacked information on sample estimation. The majority of the registered records
         and the subsequent publications clearly described the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      </p>
      <p>A comparison of registered and published primary outcomes was impossible in 25 articles
         (26.0%) because outcomes were not specified as primary outcome or secondary outcome
         in the subsequent publications. Of the remaining 71 articles, the primary outcomes
         of 32 articles (45.1%) were inconsistent with those specified in registered records
         (Table 
         <span tagx="tblr">3</span>). The discrepancies involved a registered primary outcome omitted in the published
         article (22/71, 31.0%), an absent primary outcome in the registry defined as a primary
         outcome in the published article (9/71, 12.7%), a published primary outcome registered
         as a secondary outcome (1/71, 1.4%), a registered primary outcome defined as a secondary
         outcome in the published article (15/71, 21.1%) and different timing of assessment
         of the primary outcome in the published article and the registry (12/71, 16.9%). Fourteen
         articles had two reasons for the difference in primary outcomes, five articles had
         three reasons for the difference in primary outcomes, and one article had four reasons
         for the difference in primary outcomes. This inconsistency was also addressed in 13
         articles published in journals requiring trial registration; the proportion of inconsistency
         was lower than those published in journals not requiring trial registration [13 of
         38 (34.2%) vs. 19 of 33 (57.6%); 
         <i>P</i> = 0.048]. Five of 13 articles were published in a high-impact-factor journal (IF &gt; 10).
         When comparing trials from western countries with trials from eastern countries, the
         proportion of this discrepancy showed no significant difference [6 of 21 (28.6%) vs.
         26 of 50 (52.0%); 
         <i>P</i> = 0.07].

      <p>The ‘history of changes’ was available in 44 registered trial records (44/88, 50.0%)
         from six registries. After the initial registration, a change of primary outcomes
         was identified in seven registered trial records (7/88, 8.0%), and 14 registered trial
         records (14/88, 15.9%) had the following changes: changes of study arms, sample size,
         blinding, controls and inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      <p>To assess outcome reporting bias, we identified a sample of 96 articles of acupuncture
         trials. Among them, 33.3% (32/96) articles showed clear discrepancies between the
         registered primary outcomes and the published primary outcomes. The inconsistency
         was addressed in 13 articles published in those journals requiring trial registration,
         and 5 of 13 articles were published in high-impact-factor journals. Furthermore, the
         other inconsistencies between the registry records and subsequent publications involved
         the inclusion criteria (54.7%), exclusion criteria (47.9%) and control interventions
         (22.9%). Selective outcome reporting has received widespread recognition. In previous
         studies, inconsistencies of primary outcomes between the registered records and corresponding
         publications in Western medicine varied from 18% and 49% 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Prospective trial registration provides a good opportunity for the editors and peer
         reviewers to evaluate outcome reporting bias and other deviations between the registered
         records and subsequent publications. However, we found some evidence of selective
         outcome reporting in 45.1% of the articles and other discrepancies between the published
         articles and the registered records in terms of inclusion/exclusion criteria, blinding,
         sample size, etc. These results highlight that editors and peer reviewers may not
         cross-check the consistency between the submitted manuscript and the registered records
         to identify any discrepancies, and to further limit an outcome reporting bias, even
         though they had a chance to access the registered records. A previous qualitative
         study of editors’ views on trial registration and publication bias showed that 11
         of 15 journals required trial registration as a requisite for publication, but most
         editors seldom check whether the trial is adequately registered, and some editors
         did not even enforce trial registration 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">25</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>This study also demonstrated that the trial registration number was unavailable in
         36 published reports. Our finding is consistent with previous research that also indicated
         poor reporting of the registration number in published reports 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">26</span>
         </span>. This may hamper editors and peer reviewers in accessing the registration records
         and to further assess the selective outcome reporting 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">23</span>
         </span>. Accordingly, an accurate trial registration number should be provided in the publications.
         Then, the editors and peer reviewers should systematically check the consistency between
         the submitted manuscript and registration records, especially regarding the adequate
         reporting of important items such as the primary outcome.
      </p>
      <p>As highlighted in our results, which confirmed the earlier findings 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">21</span>
         </span>, changes in the primary outcomes, as specified in the publications, from those specified
         in the registration records favored statistically significant over nonsignificant
         results. Such changes pose a threat to the reliability of results and further preclude
         clinicians and policymakers from making correct clinical decisions. Possible reasons
         for the discrepancies include the following: a preference for primary outcomes with
         statistical significance to increase the opportunity of the trial for publication
         and to support the use of the treatment 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">23</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">27</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>The main purpose of prospective registration of clinical trials is to enhance the
         transparency of the clinical trial and provide access to the trial protocol 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>. If the trial is retrospectively registered, the meaning of the trial registration
         is lost; if information in registries is insufficiently detailed, with some items
         not registered or inadequately registered, this information will be useless for comparing
         the consistency between the registered records and subsequent publications. Therefore,
         adequate registration is of great significance to safeguard against publication bias
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">21</span>
         </span>. However, our study showed that the proportion of prospective registered trials was
         still considerably low even with the introduction of the ICJME initiative policy implementation;
         registered information differed widely among trials; essential information such as
         randomization and blinding was poorly registered in the registries. Hence, the principal
         investigators and sponsors have the responsibility to adequately register a clinical
         trial. Furthermore, greater efforts should be made to improve the quality control
         processes of trial registries 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">21</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Although more than half of journals have required trial registration following the
         ICMJE guidelines, some journals use ambiguous language (i.e., encouragement of the
         trial registration) in their instruction to authors. We found similar results in previous
         studies 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">28</span>
         </span>. A lack of submission guideline clarity might contribute to explaining inadequate
         trial registration and poor reporting of registration numbers.
      </p>
      <p>We acknowledge that our study has several potential limitations. First, only trials
         indicated as having a ‘completed’ status in registries were searched for publications.
         A recent study indicated that many authors seemed to forget to change the status of
         their study to being completed, even among published studies 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">29</span>
         </span>. Therefore, those trials in the registries where the status was not listed as ‘completed’
         but that had been completed may not have been searched for and included in this study,
         which may have caused a bias.
      </p>
      <p>Second, only PubMed and three Chinese databases were searched for published reports
         on acupuncture; therefore, some trials that have been published and included in other
         databases may have been missed.

         <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Although trial registration is now the rule, we find that prospective registration
         for RCTs on acupuncture is insufficient, selective outcome reporting is prevalent,
         and the change of primary outcomes is intended to favor statistical significance.
         These discrepancies in outcome reporting may lead to biased and misleading results
         of RCTs on acupuncture. To ensure publication of reliable and unbiased results, further
         promotion and implementation of trial registration are still needed.
