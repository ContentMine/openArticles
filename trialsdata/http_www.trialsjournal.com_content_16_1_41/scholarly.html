                  <h3>Background</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Older people represent a significant proportion of patients admitted to hospital.
                  Their care compared to younger patients is more challenging, length of stay is longer,
                  risk of hospital-acquired problems higher and the risk of being re-admitted within
                  28 days greater. This study aims to compare a Community In-Reach and Care Transition
                  (CIRACT) service with Traditional Hospital Based rehabilitation (THB-Rehab) provided
                  to the older person. The CIRACT service differs from the THB-rehab service in that
                  they are able to provide more intensive hospital rehabilitation, visiting patients
                  daily, and are able to continue with the patient’s rehabilitation following discharge
                  allowing a seamless, integrated discharge working alongside community providers. A
                  pilot comparing the two services showed that the CIRACT service demonstrated reduced
                  length of stay and reduced re-admission rates when analysed over a four-month period.

                  <h3>Methods/Design</h3>
               </div>
               <p>This trial will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the CIRACT service,
                  conducted as a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with an integral qualitative mechanism
                  and action study designed to provide the explanatory and theoretical components on
                  how the CIRACT service compares to current practice. The RCT element consists of 240
                  patients over 70 years of age, being randomised to either the THB therapy group or
                  the CIRACT service following an unplanned hospital admission. The primary outcome
                  will be hospital length of stay from admission to discharge from the general medical
                  elderly care ward. Additional outcome measures including the Barthel Index, Charlson
                  Co-morbidity Scale, EuroQoL-5D and the modified Client Service Receipt Inventory will
                  be assessed at the time of recruitment and repeated at 91 days post-discharge. The
                  qualitative mechanism and action study will involve a systematic programme of organisational
                  profiling, observations of work processes, interviews with key informants and care
                  providers and tracking of participants. In addition, a within-trial economic evaluation
                  will be undertaken comparing the CIRACT and THB-rehab services to determine cost-effectiveness.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The number of people aged 70 years and over in the United Kingdom is expected to double
         by 2025 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>, with an associated increase in the proportion of unplanned medical admissions in
         this age group over the next 10 years 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. Many of these patients have multiple co-morbidities. These include poly-pharmacy,
         cognitive deficits and physical impairments which makes their care, management and
         timely discharge from hospital complex. This often prolongs length of stay and increases
         28 day re-admission rates in older patients when compared to their younger counterparts
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Nationally, over the last six years, length of stay has reduced but 28 day re-admission
         rates have increased from 11 to 14% 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>. In Nottingham, between 2010 and 2013 the mean length of stay across the medical
         elderly care wards (five wards, 6,924 patients) decreased from 14 to nine days, but
         28 day re-admission rates increased from 14 to 19% (Sahota and Fleming, 2013, unpublished
         data). The reasons for these readmissions are multi-factorial. Patients are often
         unprepared for their self-management role in the next care setting 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span> and are often unable to reach an appropriate healthcare practitioner who has access
         to their discharge summary when problems arise 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>. There simply may not be appropriate resources in the community to respond to the
         needs of these patients in a responsive manner, placing them at risk of readmissions.
         Furthermore, patient safety is often compromised during this vulnerable period, with
         high rates of medication errors 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span>, incomplete or inaccurate information on transfer 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span> and lack of appropriate follow-up care 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span>, collectively leading to fragmented discharge planning and increased rates of recidivism
         to high intensity care settings when patients’ care needs are not met 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">15</span>
         </span>. This increases health and social care costs, which will be further exacerbated by
         government plans to reduce funding if patients are re-admitted as an emergency within
         28 days of being discharged 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>In England and Wales, to address the problem of rising re-admission rates, the Department
         of Health has allocated £300 million in 2014, as part of the ‘funding for re-ablement
         linked to the hospital discharge’ funding stream 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
         </span>. This money is to be spent on developing local plans in conjunction with the Local
         Authority, Foundation Trusts and NHS Trusts and Community Health services, to facilitate
         seamless care for patients on discharge from hospital and prevent avoidable hospital
         readmissions. Some Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) have invested in ‘early supported
         discharge at home’ schemes, some into ‘community-based rehabilitation’ schemes and
         some have invested very little at all. Reviews of the literature suggest that it is
         currently unclear which is the most effective and efficient structure and organisation
         of community and intermediate care services in relation to their purpose 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>We undertook a structured literature review to identify systematic and Cochrane reviews
         of ‘early supported discharge’, ‘discharge planning from hospital to home’ and ‘care
         transition’ interventions 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

         </span>. The key components in the successful RCTs of high methodological quality were then
         identified as more intensive rehabilitation, working closer with the patient and their
         relatives and facilitating ‘care transition’ back into community, informing the frequency
         and duration of the service intervention.
      </p>
      <p>This was followed by a series of multi-perspective focus group meetings with service
         users, experienced healthcare professionals and service managers. The key aims and
         objectives of these meetings were to identify the make-up of the team and the delivery
         of the intervention. Important areas identified the need for generic rehabilitation
         staff, a dedicated allied healthcare ‘transition coach’ and senior leadership and
         governance within the team.
      </p>
      <p>The ‘care transition model’ has been proposed as a model to address potential threats
         to patient quality and safety during care transition 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">22</span>
         </span>, and has been shown to reduce early hospital re-admission rates 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>. Care transition is defined as a set of actions ensuring the coordination and continuity
         of care as patients transfer between different locations. These include logistical
         arrangements, education of the patient and family and coordination among the health
         professionals involved in the transition essential for persons with complex care needs.
         Key to this model is a home visit, ideally within 48 to 72 hours after hospital discharge.
         The aim of the visit is to ensure that the patient has received appropriate services
         and equipment, coordinate communication between primary and secondary care and review
         the patient’s goals established on discharge from hospital.
      </p>
      <p>Provision for elderly medical inpatients in Nottingham takes two forms. One consists
         of the Traditional Hospital Based multidisciplinary rehabilitation (THB-rehab) service,
         referring the patient on to different community rehabilitation and social services
         on discharge. The other is a pilot Community In-Reach rehabilitation and Care Transition
         (CIRACT) service, consisting of a senior occupational therapist, senior physiotherapist,
         social services practitioner and an assistant practitioner, working more closely across
         multiple boundaries with patients and their carers. The CIRACT intervention is set
         apart from other models of care as although the team is based on the hospital ward,
         they are employed by a community NHS provider (NHS Nottingham City Care Partnership),
         and therefore are able to bring their community expertise into the hospital care setting,
         bridging the gap between the community and hospital settings. In addition, the CIRACT
         service aims to i) provide intensive rehabilitation; ii) work closely with the patient,
         relatives and community-based health and social care professionals to facilitate and
         access a wider range of care and services in the community and iii) provide a community
         follow-up service.
      </p>
      <p>Pilot data suggest that compared to the THB-rehab service, the CIRACT service can
         reduce median length of stay and 28 day re-admission rates, over a four-month period.
         However the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the service needs to be evaluated in
         a randomised trial.

            <h3>Objectives</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The primary objective of the CIRACT trial is to assess whether length of hospital
            stay for unplanned hospital admission among people aged 70 years or older allocated
            to receive the CIRACT service is different compared with the THB-rehab. The secondary
            objectives include assessing the effects of the CIRACT service on re-admission rates
            within 28 days post-discharge; super spell bed days (total time in NHS care); patient
            function and patient health-related quality of life. Alongside this, the qualitative
            part of the trial aims to investigate the design and delivery of the CIRACT service
            and assess service user experiences of the two forms of rehabilitation delivery. The
            health economics part of the study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the
            CIRACT service compared to the THB-rehab service.

            <h3>Study intervention</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Each participant will be randomly allocated to the CIRACT service (intervention arm)
            or THB-rehab (control arm). The CIRACT team will conduct an assessment of the participant’s
            ability to perform certain tasks within 24 hours of randomization, enabling the formulation
            of a comprehensive rehabilitation plan. The CIRACT team will consist of a physiotherapist,
            an occupational therapist and a community care officer who will be employed by Nottingham
            CityCare, but will be based on one of the study wards. While in hospital the participants
            will be treated daily (seven days a week, if appropriate) by the CIRACT team and the
            time of rehabilitation they receive will be dependent on their needs. During the participant’s
            hospital stay the CIRACT team will liaise with the participant and their carer(s)
            to visit the participant’s home to assess and provide recommendations for equipment
            and make adaptations and/or modifications if required. The CIRACT service will utilise
            the teams’ expertise in community working to form links with the appropriate services
            to ensure a smooth and effective discharge. In more complex cases the CIRACT team
            will take the participant out of the hospital for a home visit prior to discharge.
            Following discharge, the CIRACT team will visit the participant at home within 48 hours
            of discharge to assess the level of rehabilitation required at home, and the CIRACT
            team will undertake further follow-up visits as deemed necessary.
         </p>
         <p>The THB-rehab service will be provided by the hospital-based therapy teams on weekdays
            only as a control group receiving ‘usual care’. Members of these teams will jointly
            conduct an assessment of the participant’s ability to perform certain tasks and provide
            recommendation for rehabilitation. The ward team will refer the participant to the
            appropriate community-based services for the provision of equipment at home, personal
            care and ongoing rehabilitation where appropriate at discharge. Once discharged from
            hospital, the patient will have no contact with the ward rehabilitation staff.
         </p>
         <p>In either group, if a participant becomes medically unwell at any point to the extent
            they are no longer able to undertake therapy (as directed by the ward doctor), the
            treating team will withhold further therapy until being instructed by the ward doctor
            it is safe to recommence therapy. The nursing and medical care provided by the ward
            staff will not differ between the two groups.

         </div>
         <p>The qualitative, implementation and action study aims to understand the situated activities
            and interactions that constitute the CIRACT service in comparison to THB-rehab service,
            and to understand how these mechanics of care interact with other factors located
            in the wider care system. This will investigate how the service is perceived by all
            participants in terms of transitional planning, effective therapy delivery and the
            general organisational aspects in relation to the concurrent services provided within
            the research wards.
         </p>
         <p>The qualitative appraisal also draws upon recent developments in the field of implementation
            science. It is widely recognised that new interventions or ways of working do not
            easily move from policy into practice, but are transformed and even inhibited by the
            contexts into which change is desired, especially professional boundaries 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">30</span>
            </span>. Recent developments in implementation science have led to new approaches for understanding
            this process, such as the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services
            (PARIHS) framework and Normalisation Process Theory. This appraisal of CIRACT was
            informed by Damschroder 
            <i>et al</i>.’s 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">31</span>
            </span> consolidated framework. This draws attention to a range of key factors that frame
            and are involved in the implementation of new practices including:
         </p>
         <p>1. Characteristics of the intervention itself.</p>
         <p>2. The outer and inner context (outer context referring to the wider institutional,
            political and social environment, with the inner context referring to the internal
            organisational environment where change is to be made).
         </p>
         <p>3. The role of individuals and groups within the given context including their sense-making,
            mind-sets, cultures and networks.
         </p>
         <p>A range of behavioural theories inform analysis of individual behaviours, but this
            study adopts a socio-cultural practice perspective that considers how social practices
            are embedded within wider social and cultural fields of influence, whilst allowing
            for individual agency. This is especially relevant in healthcare settings given the
            influence of professional cultures and boundaries on practices. The final aspect is
            the implementation processes itself which cuts through involves the above factors.
            The model also suggests that implementation is non-linear and can cut across organisational
            and practice levels.

               draws analytical attention to: i) the nature of CIRACT including how it is configured,
               disseminated and translated into practice settings; ii) the role of wider changes
               within the organisation and delivery acute and community care, including wider political
               issues, financial and regulatory issues; iii) the influence of local organising factors
               such as resources and staffing, modes of working and professional boundaries and iv)
               the role of local actors, especially CIRACT and ward staff, but also patients and
               carers.
            </p>
            <p>This will involve three linked activities (A to C), linked to three research techniques
               (D to F).
            </p>
            <p>A. Each rehabilitation service will be described and analysed to understand the local
               context factors that might shape service delivery, including staffing and resource
               levels, participant group type and variability, provision of support services, service
               culture, receptivity to change and team/and professional work dynamics.
            </p>
            <p>B. In a purposive selection of participants, the organisation and delivery of the
               intervention will be described and analysed in-depth to understand how the service
               is configured and how therapy is planned and delivered.
            </p>
            <p>C. The views and experiences of professionals and participants at each participating
               site will be described and analysed to understand their involvement in, reactions
               to and continued use of both forms of rehabilitation.
            </p>
            <p>D. Organisational profiling: involving a relatively standardised checklist pro forum
               of known contextual and organisational variables known to influence implementation
               of change and the delivery of complex intervention. This will be completed through
               focussed visits, guided tours and key stakeholder interviews. These will be undertaken
               over a two to three day period and recorded using a standard form to facilitate rapid
               data analysis and comparison.
            </p>
            <p>E. More detailed observations of service organisation and delivery over a period of
               three to four weeks within a purposive selection of participants. This will be informed
               by the principles of ethnographic observation, with the research undertaking prolonged
               periods of direct observation of how the service is organised and delivered.
            </p>
            <p>F. Qualitative interviews and focus groups with representative groups of professionals
               and participants to understand their shared and distinct experiences of service delivery
               of each form of rehabilitation.
            </p>

         </div>
         <p>A detailed cost analysis of the two services to the NHS will be considered from a
            time and motion study, and compared against cost estimates based on standard methods
            of collecting resource use information (here via a modified Client Service Receipt
            Inventory (CSRI) questionnaire 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">27</span>
            </span> at baseline and at 91 days post-discharge). The detailed micro-costing study will
            be conducted in three phases:
         </p>
         <p>1. A structured literature review (phase one): The review will provide information
            on how to conduct the time and motion study (phase three).
         </p>
         <p>2. Observation and semi-structured interviews (phase two): Observations and interviews
            will provide information on how to conduct the time and motion study (phase three)
            and define what activities are undertaken by each service. The observations of the
            therapists will enable a greater understanding of what each team offers and how they
            differ in their service provision. This will allow comparisons to be drawn between
            the two groups.
         </p>
         <p>3. Micro-costing study (phase 3): using the information from phase one and two a time
            and motion study will be conducted with 10 patients in each arm, recruited through
            purposive sampling, over a six-month period. Within each treatment arm, we will aim
            to include half of the participants with baseline admission Barthel ADL of less than
            14, and the other half with a Barthel ADL of greater than 14, in order to ensure a
            wide range of abilities are observed. The time and motion study will record therapy
            interactions with the patient (face-to-face and indirect) to enable costing of each
            service provision. To get this data an RA will contact the ward therapists or the
            CIRACT team (depending on allocation) on a twice daily basis and ask how much time
            they have spent in direct face-to-face contact with the patient and indirectly, through
            non-face-to-face contact (ward rounds, telephone calls, referrals, and so forth).
         </p>
         <p>To capture the contacts with therapists post-discharge, the RA will establish from
            the therapists if they have been referred on for further therapy and, if so, the contact
            details of the community-based team. The RA will then contact the treating therapist
            in the community to gather contact time (non-face-to-face may then include travel
            time) for two weeks following discharge. This will provide us with the data required
            to cost the contact time for each patient and enable comparisons between groups. The
            specific activities undertaken by the therapists with the patient will be explored
            through phase two.

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>This article describes the protocol of a randomised trial comparing the clinical and
         cost-effectiveness of the THB-rehab service, with that of the CIRACT service. The
         outcome of the study will influence clinical decision-making, with respect to allocation
         of resources linked to hospital discharge planning and re-admissions, in a very resource
         intensive and growing group of patients.
      </p>
      <p>The theoretical model underpinning the CIRACT service has been based on the Medical
         Research Council framework, funded by a Research and Development Pump Priming Research
         award (Nottingham University Hospitals Charitable funds) and re-ablement funding stream
         (Nottingham City CCG).
      </p>
      <p>Most early and/or supported discharge models in care of the older person involve receiving
         patients back into the community from hospital, with little or no direct involvement
         in hospital-based rehabilitation. The novel aspect of the CIRACT intervention compared
         to other models of care is that although the team will be based on the hospital ward,
         they will be employed by a community NHS provider enabling the team to bring their
         community knowledge into the hospital care setting, in addition to providing more
         intensive rehabilitation, working closer with the patient and their relatives and
         being able to facilitate and access a wider range of care and services in the community.
         This is in contrast to the hospital ward-based therapists, employed by the hospital,
         who may not have the knowledge and direct and/or rapid accessibility of care and services
         in the community.
      </p>
      <p>From a financial and cost point of view, we know that the NHS is facing unprecedented
         financial challenges over the next few years. Therefore any new service requires both
         clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence to support decision-making. However, many
         research studies lack good quality costing or cost-effectiveness data, and where studies
         have been published, average cost of events are often assigned using national and
         centre-specific price weights, which may not reflect true costs. Micro-costing studies
         involve direct enumeration and detailed costing of each input consumed 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">39</span>
         </span> although are infrequently undertaken in complex interventional studies. Therefore,
         in addition to the clinical evaluation of the CIRACT service, we propose to undertake
         a cost and cost-effectiveness evaluation of this service delivery.
      </p>
      <p>One of the main limitations of this study is that the ward staff and participants
         cannot be blinded to the rehabilitation group allocation as both services are provided
         within each ward. However, early pilot work 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">40</span>
         </span> demonstrated that participants and staff very quickly become unaware of group allocation,
         presumably related to the fluid nature of the ward environment and that much of the
         rehabilitation is undertaken away from the bedside. Baseline data will be collected
         prior to randomisation and outcome measures collected by a blinded RA to minimize
         the risk of detection bias. A statistician blind to group assignment will perform
         the data analysis.
